The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.

Though I wouldn't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste.  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of.

I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The zero carb sports drinks didn't help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!<br /><br />I've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.<br /><br />These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work.....

I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. Order in cold weather and buy enough to last!!!

She has awful food allergy's and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didn't have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to. She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.. she seems to like that better. We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it. If your dog has allergy's or stomach issue.. or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it! You will see a difference in your pet.

96;B0019CW0HE;A1BFNM27629VAV;E. Triebe;0;0;5;1320105600;Good healthy dog food;I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.

I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion

It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.

This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going. It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong. The stronger it is the less you use as well. The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost. I thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad. This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like.

Haney;2;2;5;1323820800;Great for after lunch;These little guys are tasty and refreshing.<br /><br />I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath.  I eat 2 of these after lunch (because they are so small) and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem.<br /><br />They're sugar free (sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow) which is great and they're tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch.<br /><br />This is a good bulk value buy and I'd highly recommend the mints themselves.  Cheers!

One co-worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes. Like I said

218;B0040WAG7Q;A19SDJ2TSSL8HI;K. Mcgee;0;0;3;1347667200;More Hot/Spicy than McCormick's Brand;My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us. It definitely makes you sweat a bit when you're eating it. It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I don't think I would buy it again due to the heat. We prefer the milder McCormick's brand of Fajita mix. I've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix is.<br /><br />If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag

This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.<br /><br />Let me just say this

The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.<br /><br />I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away. The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally).<br /><br />This is a great tasting tea

I use it maybe once a week at the most. I drink 1/2 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how I feel. IMO this doesn't replace my a.m. coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when I start to fade. Once in a while I drink a full bottle before a workout. I've been drinking Guayaki Yerba Mate teas for years. Compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there I highly recommend this. This product is clean and doesn't leave nasty chems behind in the body. Try it before you judge from a review - everyone's body reacts differently.

It's also nice to have something gluten-free for friends who are borderline diabetic...but I would eat them anyway.

I bought them because brown rice is a good carb.  As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients.  The name is deceptive - these have Masa corn flour listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste.  I won't buy these again - I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste.

That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own

Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour

I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color

But the point is that more than 50% in the bag is over-fried and in brown color. I really suffer eating the over-fried chips. I open some other bags and it looks like the same. So I just throw away all of them. I don't know if I was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same. But for sure I will never buy this brand any more.

These are by far the best.  I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy.  They seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste.

But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.

They are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips.  The flavor out performs any tortilla chip I have ever eaten.  They hold up great to salsas and dips.  Nothing wimpy about them.  I just wish the company made a bigger bag!  Love them.  Usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery

My case of chips came without any packing inside.  All bags in a box with no cushioning at all.  Needless to say most of the chips were broken and I would not order them again.  A great item but if they can't package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money.

Because of the higher price and being sold like a gourmet item I wrongly thought it would be better than the affordable brands sold at the supermarket.  Wrong.

I knew by reading reviews that there wouldn't be enough yellow frosting so I whipped up so edible glue (water and confectionery sugar) to hold the levels of gingerbread that make the pineapple and save the yellow frosting for the outside - this worked great. It was a really fun idea that we enjoyed creating. The licorice was worthless though...

I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found. Which is odd. I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week. I looked everywhere and could not find ont. So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday. I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The gingerbread itself came broken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken. It's non returnable. I called Amazon

The caramel is liquid and complements the Ghiradelli chocolate perfectly. Do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight - you will end up an addict like me.<br />  The Ghiradelli product is far better than the Caramello/Hershey product in every way. The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares

This tea is my daily regular tea. Yunnan is nice in that it will brew dark so you do not need much at a time. It's aromatic and flavorful without any additives. If you want something that is flowery yet more subtle than Earl Grey this Yunnan or a Keemun may be a nice option to explore.

877;B000HDMUQ2;AGC3K4KSI67RI;Joanne Macek;2;2;5;1184544000;Good berry flavor;My son with multiple food allergies really enjoys these bars.  I find that they have a good berry taste.  They also have a nice chewyness.
878;B000HDMUQ2;A30NECNFHHBT3H;Lp;0;0;4;1340236800;great taste But size it smaller;i love them. not too sweet but just right. any allergy free food is great in my book. hope non of these ingredients contains Corn...thats a no no for me too. HOWEVER I DONT APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT I OPENED MY NEW BOX AND THE CUT 1/4 OF IT OFF. IF THE SIZE IT LESS THEN SO SHOULD THE CHARGE. THIS WILL EFFECT MY DECISION IN BUYING AGAIN. I AM NOT A TODDLER I NEED A REAL SIZE BAR PLEASE

Very deceptive advertising.  That and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star.  My 10 year old son ate one and didn't like them. I ate one and agreed as did my husband.  Couldn't give it away!  Everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as I'm concerned.

He enjoys most of the Earth's Best foods and we have only found a couple he doesn't eat (anything with too much apple) which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination.

Also I like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste. I just learned this and am telling everyone - only glass recycles forever. And if you don't recycle then you and I have nothing in common and you should stop reading here. It's not even a hard thing to do anymore. Nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy. You just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day. Stop being lazy.

I have never seen it in a tea bag before. I found that to get the taste I remember I needed 2 bags per cup. The bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that I will buy again and again. Plus the shipping time was great.
955;B000S806VM;A2HF72GRWTRW35;James H. Walder Jim Walder;3;3;4;1299196800;sassafrass tea;I grew up in Ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful. I would dig tender roots or bark a few trees for a delightful tea.  I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product.  Not a good bargain.  I switched to Pappy's extract.

960;B000S806VM;A3FIUP4KF49FOH;K;0;0;1;1347926400;K;I first tasted Sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it.  So I started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form.  After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea.  I was told is was Pappy's Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked online and found it at Amazon.com.  As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought I'd order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didn't taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice

You do nothing but mix it with water. Takes only a minute or two. I highly recommend this gravy mix. It will not disappoint.
972;B0002XIB2Y;A1891H0TIXLDXA;Donald M. Bridges;1;2;5;1250294400;Pioneer Gravy is GREAT!;I have used Pioneer Gravy for a number of years.  It is VERY easy to make and tastes great

974;B001EQ4DVQ;AHMCLSA49GPHK;David Boston;7;7;5;1265673600;More expensive online;I am a coffee fanatic but have always stayed away from these because I never liked instant coffee and my assumption was that this would be similar.  I really enjoy the Starbucks VIA instant coffee - but I drink so much
975;B001EQ4DVQ;AXZTWAX77RHPG;William Strickler;3;3;4;1194998400;Very Convenient and far better than instant coffee;I don't think these coffee bags are as good as fresh ground fresh brewed coffee

977;B001EQ4DVQ;A37FCSX7K7GEFT;K. Li;1;1;4;1182038400;Simple. Convenient;I live in the dorms without a kitchen so making a cup of coffee was really easy with this. Especially when I need to stay up late to study or to wake up after 2 hours of sleep. Its just like making tea and tastes decent enough. Not starbucks but good enough with some sugar and cream.
978;B001EQ4DVQ;A680RUE1FDO8B;Jerry Saperstein;0;0;5;1259452800;Brews an excellent cup of coffee quickly and easily;My primary point with this review is to note that this packaging is less expensive than the other size offered by Folger. You get more coffee for less money.<br /><br />  I recently started drinking coffee again after a lapse of many years. Since I didn't know how many cups a day I would use

982;B004DTNJU2;A1C3LSDRPLFZ62;Hank Schwartz;3;3;5;1297814400;new to rooibos tea;I gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit. And I'm glad I did. It has a somewhat sweet and almost minty taste and a wonderful aroma. It has a nice reddish color. This tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green matcha tea I've had
983;B004DTNJU2;A4D9AIUP1NNIY;Hotrod;0;0;5;1341705600;Tasted better than loose leaf rooibos;I tried this before having normal red tea so I waited to review. The flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity. The color is that of muddy water
984;B004DTNJU2;A1YQORA01YBBLS;Md_Jd;0;0;5;1325635200;Best matcha quality and price;I previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price.  I decided to give Pure Matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive.  The quality of Pure Matcha's products surpasses that of all others I have tried- stays fresh

989;B006F2NYI2;A36WE3X9G0DZUZ;Gale P;2;2;5;1324339200;love this hot sauce;I was never much of a hot sauce fan until I tasted Black Market Hot Sauce. I was listning to the radio one morning and the creater/owner was giving an interview

993;B006F2NYI2;AHSURYHM6ZZXC;Nuttmeg;2;2;5;1323734400;Tasty hot sauce!;This is my favorite hot sauce. I buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have. Hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy! My favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far. Thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce!
994;B006F2NYI2;A1KFUVZ3BZ59R1;Merplinger;2;2;5;1323734400;Best all around hot sauce;So far I have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing. My fiance and I use them nearly daily and I just picked up 3 more. It goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kick.<br /><br />The sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears. It is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use. We love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice.
995;B006F2NYI2;A1T5CH6SHV989P;A Biemold;2;2;5;1323734400;best hot sauce around;absolutely love the habenaro sauce...use it on eggs

1008;B006GK4XVA;A3MDETK0D5UAIN;Xoxo Woodfairy;0;0;3;1349308800;Smells like roses but no safety or freshness seal.;The smell at first was just like a bed of fresh roses. Even though the rose content is very minimal I found the smell overwhelming. I did not like that this brand of spices does not have a seal in place and only a loosely screwed on lid. There is no shaker lid either. You open it and it dumps. I am questioning how only a few minute pieces of roses could produce such a perfume odor. I hope it is not chemically enhanced. With the lid being loose and not sealed I have doubts about the safety of the product.

If I wanted a cheap product that I knew was low quality and from China then I would have bought them directly from their site at $7 for 38 of them!!! However

So I rewrapped them using clear bags purchased from Michaels. Also a few were cracked or broken
1180;B00283V4GQ;AJGU56YG8G1DQ;E. Kennedy;2;2;5;1313366400;Very Cute!;I used these and a bunch of other colored lollipops for a friend's birthday and she got a kick out of it.  She had been complaining about feeling old so we threw a kid themed party.  She had a great time.  I don't think it's possible to eat one of these spiral lollipops without feeling like a kid!

I could have saved money by ordering them directly from Oriental Trading Company which is clearly where they came from. they look cheap and they're not as colorful as shown in the picture. the Oriental Trading Company information is on the back of the wrappers on the lollipops. most of the lollipop sticks are bent and two lollipops arrived broken. the box only has 12 lollipops
1183;B00283V4GQ;AV2VEYY6SXUGQ;Ace;1;1;5;1318809600;Great service;I had purchased these to go along with a Candyland costume for Halloween.

None of the lollipops were broken in transit.<br /><br />It turns out the costume I ordered (from another seller) didn't fit at all and was made of very cheap material so I couldn't even alter it to fit.  Since I had to return the costume

The lollipops are 2 inches and I used 1.5 inch thank you stickers on them.  So cute!  The description states that 16 lollipops are included in the order.  I ordered 2 boxes and only received 12 lollipops in each box.  I contacted the seller's customer service.  I received a response and apology right away.  They promptly corrected the order.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive another full box of 12 and not just the 8 I expected.  The lollipops are wrapped in bubble wrap.  Out of three boxes only one lollipop was cracked.  Not a big deal to me since I did receive an extra box.  Great lollipop at a great price.

I have kept them and plan to use again for future parties.  these will  not be consumed so no idea how they taste...

I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons

Two 12 oz trays will be enough for 4 adults so really not worth the money honestly. $10 for two little trays is a lot even for the ease and quality. Like I said they were good and easy to prepare and thankfully only four of us for x-mas dinner today or I wouldn't have had enough. 24 oz. of potatoes sounds bigger then it is lol.

I tried it first hot and then used the remainder for ice tea and both were really good.  The company delivered super fast too which was great.  I recommend this tea highly
1242;B000OK7UDG;A1WFB999A4AQYK;J. Fischer;3;5;1;1252022400;Can't detect the prickly pear;Loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form.  This tea is black tea with prickly pear flavor. The shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea.  If there is a prickly pear component it is all but undetectable when I drink it. It just tastes like regular black tea.  Very disappointing.

Commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted. Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isn't. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste

1371;B0013JQON4;A265ZN83B11MSQ;Tabitha;2;2;5;1338076800;Best for Sweets :];I am a big fan of Sorghum flour for my baked goods. It gives everything a bit of sponge (especially cakes) and adds an extra bit of sweet to the baking. I highly recommend this for baking flour mixes - you may not want to add it to savory recipes though because of the light sweet flavor.

It's cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients. I couldn't believe how she gobbled this up. BUT after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach. Took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days. Her hair also wasn't as soft. This kibble did not do well for her.

No doubt about the quality of the food and my 5 month old dachuhund puppy loves it. But I realized this doesn't have DHA that helps to develop cognitive brain function. Also the kibble might be little big for a puppy. So I believe it's a great food for an adult dog

Pliler;0;0;5;1329004800;Excellent chips;Just to give a little background - I ordered these because they were a great deal for a box of single serving chips and I thought I would give them a try.  The variety of flavors in this package was great and I enjoy most of them.  These chips leave a lot less mess than your average bags of potato chips and there are very few crumbs in the bag.  It is apparent these are not prepared like normal chips and the result is a differently textured chip.  It will be a personal taste as to whether or not you will like the taste and texture

I love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet I have not found a flavor I did not like. Being from England I am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as I would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors I can't complain. I also love the fact that 5% fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack. My only issue now is that I have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as I do. I have now had to go to a box a month but even then I am not sure I can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can.

1632;B001RVFDOO;A1IAM1NQF1CXL7;Lady Di;0;0;5;1315785600;Don't Defeat the Purpose by Eating Two Bags at Once!;I have to watch my calories
1633;B001RVFDOO;A2QVO0RUT9D8JR;Bernadette G. Stephens Honey_In_Houston;0;0;4;1315267200;Great for diet;The product is exactly what it is portrayed to be. Tasty (not yummy) but good. I received the product promptly. I ordered 2 cases and will eat every package.
1634;B001RVFDOO;A2OG042EUQ8XG5;Diane Haynes;0;0;5;1314489600;Best Chips Ever;I love these chips
1635;B001RVFDOO;AHWHI3SPJ2PHO;Ruth Powers Retired Teacher;0;0;5;1313712000;Pop Chips;These are delicious.  My husband and I just love them.  Especially the BBQ and Salt and Vinegar flavors.  I like the individual packages.  It's a wonderful bargain when you get free shipping!
1636;B001RVFDOO;A1HCR858WADMHD;Kstickley;0;0;4;1313712000;A yummy alternative to high-fat chips!;I'm a crunchaholic! I have to have something during the day to crunch! All other chips are so high in fat or sodium that it makes it very difficult to be eating healthy and still get my crunch on. PopChips is the answer and the individual bags are a great way to control your calories too! I highly recommend them all
1637;B001RVFDOO;A6Y6Y1F2APJRS;Jenp;0;0;5;1313107200;yummy popchips;These are the best snacks for me as I am a lap band patient.  They fill u up just enough and the small bags are perfect size
1638;B001RVFDOO;A36EA1M8V6GNPG;K. Lynch;0;0;3;1311724800;Taste yummy but watch out for yeast extract intolerance!;Yum! I had tried the original and the Bar-b-q and really liked them so decided to get the variety pack. For whatever reason the 24 pack is cheaper then the 12. The flavored ones do contain a yeast extract which is similar to MSG and gave my grandmother a bad headache. So if you know anyone that has a sensitivity to MSG
1639;B001RVFDOO;AFZLBRCW8VPPU;A. C. Teeple;0;0;5;1311638400;Love Pop Chips!;A dream for those on Weight Watchers who love potato chips. The individual serving bags of Pop Chips are only 3 points and taste delicious.
1640;B001RVFDOO;A3VIACKGC8CBXV;Carrie Fugett;0;0;5;1311292800;Pop Crisps;These are a Great size and healthy.  They satisfy the craving for something crisp and are reasonable calorie wise.
1641;B001RVFDOO;A3T1FVDD87NYO4;Becky Payne;0;0;5;1311292800;GREAT PRODUCT!;These chips are GREAT substitute for the usual high calorie ones offered!  I keep them on hand to aid in my weight loss venture.
1642;B001RVFDOO;A1PHUCTJ9X9EHJ;Godsambassador;0;0;2;1310860800;Did not care for these. Only liked bbq. Wondering why these are best-sellers;I bought these and tried each flavor. I could not even finish any bag but the barbecue. I really liked the barbecue but all the other flavors were gross. And the texture is really like fingernails on a chalk board to me. HOw is this the #1 best-selling item? Amazed. Anywho to each his own! Godbless and enjoy. But if you are like me and enjoy barbecue just get the barbecue kind!
1643;B001RVFDOO;A5RU262HIHBZC;Suzm Suzm;0;0;5;1310256000;OMG!  So delicious;I can't believe these are actually decent for you.  They taste awesome!  I love these chips
1644;B001RVFDOO;A190F2M4WPMSNZ;Boog;0;0;5;1310256000;great chips;I am on weight watchers and these chips are only 3 points and they taste GREAT.  I like every kind
1645;B001RVFDOO;AVQDEM0DQJC0B;Gary D. Church Pawnman;0;0;5;1304380800;Great product;This is a great product. I was a chip-a-holic and knew I needed to cut back on them. Then I was introduced to pop-chips.I have found my alternative. These chips are great! Low in fats but high in flavor. I purchsed a mixed case with multiple flavors and was not disappointed with any of them. Consider this product for your alternative to the high fat chips available everywhere. I am sure these will catch on and become a big hit.
1646;B001RVFDOO;A2NDW673KP3HSS;Laura Ang;0;0;5;1304294400;they grow on you!;Saw these in Whole Foods and thought they looked interesting. Didn't care for them instantly
1647;B001RVFDOO;A194U71OZ5YTLH;K. Kumar;0;0;5;1304294400;Yummy:);We received our assorted single serve packs today. This is the first time we ordered Popchips. They taste so good. We are already down by 5 packets between adults and kids.<br />Please bear in mind that these chips will in no way compete with regular fried potato chips. The low calories per bag is very much a part of why they deserve 5 stars. I'm sure we will be ordering more. Yay to finding a new healthier snack alternative.
1648;B001RVFDOO;A18GRF94T65X9Z;Reem Chavez;0;0;5;1303862400;Best chips!;I wa hesitant about ordering this product simply because I never ordered snacks of the internet
1649;B001RVFDOO;A1O4QLQRY8GI6T;A. Copper Library Girl;0;0;5;1303171200;Perfect Pop Chips;I am a huge fan of Pop Chips. They had them at my grocery store
1650;B001RVFDOO;A2N3GSVCG76JTB;James Luna The Architect;0;0;5;1303084800;Just my 2 cents...;I have this on a monthly reoccurring purchase making the per unit price even lower that list.  That being said
1651;B001RVFDOO;A1BX4EZ3UGX2HX;Mt;0;0;3;1302652800;Quite delicious but not as good as real chips;Definitely better than Pirate Booty and slightly better than Baked chips. Very tasty but you feel as if you're almost eat something with the same texture as cereal. It's a small payoff to enjoy chips (albeit faux chips). The Vinegar and S/P ones are NASTY!
1652;B001RVFDOO;A39ILC0QR4E09L;A. Schneider;0;0;4;1301702400;Interesting... however I've found something else...;I bought the 6-flavor variety pack.  They are pretty good... nice thing is that I'm not 100% sure if I'm crazy about the texture so by the end of an 0.8 oz bag I don't really want anymore.  However in my quest for different snack foods I found the Food Should Taste Good line of cracker chips.  My money will be spent on those rather than pop chips.  However I think that people should give these a try as well.
1653;B001RVFDOO;AQXYD1H2ZQ9NN;Frugalshopper;0;0;5;1299888000;Love These Chips;The BBQ chips are great.  We liked them better than regular chips.  They have a nice crunch.  Hate Kettle chips which are so hard that they are like eating shards of glass.<br /><br />We will definitely be buying more of the Popchips.
1654;B001RVFDOO;A2MW2W7H1DUOF8;Sven The Educated;0;0;5;1299801600;tast great less lard.;These really are good I gave some to other people and they liked them too. The plain flavored ones take well to using them as scoops for your own dip or salsa. When eating the BBq flavored ones brings back memories of yester years when I would eat BBq pork skins while riding in the back of the truck on the range. I think the pepper ones could use more pepper but they are all still good and make a good snack or side dish to lunch at 100 Cal per pack.
1655;B001RVFDOO;A9CGRZG2ISSC9;Angela Campana Gella;0;0;5;1299110400;OMG!!!! The Best Snack Ever!!!;To those of you

1660;B001RVFDOO;A26H90YYINQRR1;Jean Page;0;0;5;1297468800;The Snacker;My whole family loves these chips.  I am following the Weight Watchers plan and the whole bag is only 3 points

1665;B001RVFDOO;A36WJIKDKQDA05;E. A. Heckman Eilene;0;0;5;1296432000;Tasty!;I bought these when they were on a Gold Box deal...thinking that it would be a nice inexpensive toss in for a month of lunches...and then I'd never buy them again.<br /><br />Not so...<br /><br />They're actually really tasty!  Exceptionally crunchy!  And the flavor is similar to kettle cooked chips.  Definitely going on subscribe and save for a while.<br /><br />I don't think they're any more salty than standard potato chips...but they're by no means low salt.
1666;B001RVFDOO;A1EDX1UZ64LA7J;Dawne;0;0;5;1296259200;Topchips!;Popchips are a great guilt-free way to add some crunchy satisfaction to your diet without added excess fat and sugar. They are clean

1816;B001RVFDOO;A2RL1RS6PWUHWI;Jennifer Ackerman;2;2;2;1336608000;Too strong of flavors;I love shrimp chips and I love healthier alternatives as well so I thought these would be a match made in heaven. Not so much. The flavors were too strong most of the time (I am a huge fan of pepper but even I had a hard time enjoying the salt & pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is -- and this is from someone who currently lives in the UK and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here) and too bleh in others. The only flavors that my husband and I both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again.<br /><br />I wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say
1817;B001RVFDOO;A1CSPUEJPB8ZDD;Sam;2;2;3;1330128000;If you're expecting full chip flavor reconsider getting another brand of chips.;I expected from the extremely positive reviews on the site for full flavor healty chips. In reality I get an OKAY taste with a strange aftertaste on basically all of the flavors. Chedder and Salt&Pepper honestly being some of the worst tasting chips I've ever had. If you're just looking for a great tasting brand of chips with health as a #2 on the list there are much much better brands out there. In the end I compare these chips to diet soda vs regular
1818;B001RVFDOO;A364Z8P1YEV5NS;K. Pollock;2;2;5;1316649600;Great for losing weight!;I ordered these chips because they got so many good reviews and I'm so glad I did.<br />All of the flavors are tasty and satisfying. At 100 calories a bag

1821;B001RVFDOO;AH4GXZ45GSP54;Henryy;2;2;3;1286841600;Tasty but Salty;So for a healthier snack it sure is salty. But then the salt is a way for them to make the chips taste better without additional calories. Each bag is 100 calories with 10% sodium intake for the day.<br /><br />The chips are not bad

It was nothing like what I expected (granted that I expected good old kettle cooked potato chips). I bought the 6-flavor variety pack and there were many flavors I did not care for. It was worth trying them but I am not going to purchase them again in the future.

The most important part to being on weight watchers is too find food items that let you feel like your not giving anything up.  Popchips do that for me.  They are only 2 points plus on weight watcher's.  They go great with every meal (salad

(While you can);I had seen these advertised on the Hungry Girl website but was not big on buying an expensive potato chip.  I was given a free bag at some event & found them to be tasty.  The single serve bags in the grocery store were $1 for a 0.8 oz bag.  Buy them from here and they are $21 for 24 1 oz bags. (Same amount of Weight Watchers points.) If you get two cases

BBq to salty but if you like a little twang its ok. according to the family. Plain is horrible. Salt and vinegar was the best overall. My family gave it 3 stars i will stick to kettle chips-

I hate spending money on herbs just to use a little and have the rest go bad shortly after.  I put some herbs (mostly basil) in here and they were fresh for a few weeks!  No leakage probs either

1923;B0016PKA1C;A3SKJR85RGGZG7;Goosedude Goosedude;1;1;3;1300665600;Would be a great product....if it was easier to open;I got one of these for XMAS...and to be honest it does work well and does extend the life of your fresh herbs while providing an attractive container.<br /><br />The main problem is the container is difficult to open. It does get easier over time but whoever designed this thing should not have made it so hard from the get go.<br /><br />The thing is its very easy to open when there is nothing inside it as you can you use as much force as needed open it (you don't need to open the bottom....just squeeze the sides and pull the plastic cover up and out FIRMLY). Don't worry...you won't break it. It is pretty sturdy plastic.<br /><br />The real issue is when it is filled or has water in it...its difficult to use that much force and popping it open without spilling.<br /><br />I've just resorted to emptying the water reservoir through its fill port....then popping it.<br /><br />PREPARA...please read these reviews and improve on the next design!!!

Disappointing;I've been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herb/vegetable/salad bins inside to grow vegetables and I thought the Prepara Herb Savor Pod looked like the perfect precursor. Wrong. The detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere. Similarly

1936;B000F4EU52;A38DUAG2FRUMBK;David Daniel;8;9;1;1244073600;Not Safe!;After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there. I would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health!

In particular I adore papayas and mangos.  The fruit juice instead of syrup is also very nice.  The easy pull-top on the can makes this a great item to stash in my desk drawer at work

2008;B001E5E29A;A2C0EA9W5M7HEL;Diane Arnett Mifelizdia;1;1;5;1331078400;BEST PANCAKES OF MY LIFE;These pancakes just hit the spot and make me feel like I am eating a restaurant breakfast at home for a lot less money. Splurge on this and the good maple syrup...it really is cheaper than going to Denny's or IHOP where a meal for two will be $20 minimum.
2009;B001E5E29A;A2H5ZMH5TFB9GK;Hrvats;1;1;4;1316304000;pretty darn good but at an increased cost;Let me start by saying my family loves this stuff.  It has a fairly strong flavor of vanilla.  It cooks up nicce and light.  My problem with this product is the recent price increase.  It was a good product at a fair price but now it is pricey.  All-in-all I would suggest that you order this at least once to taste what good pancakes are supposed to taste like.  After that I would suggest playing with recepies on your own.

Somehow Hungry Jack felt like an afront to such a sublime kitchen appliance. I read the reviews here on Amazon and concluded that despite the rather high price

2013;B001E5E29A;A1IH5YW0X6DE26;Deb;1;1;4;1302393600;A great backup from scratch;This is the pancake mix we go to when we don't have buttermilk in the fridge (don't think the vinegar trick is worth it so we always do fresh) to make Alton Brown's buttermilk pancake recipe.  This Stonewall mix is a good option and the flavor is the best of any store bought mix by far! It might cost more

It makes the best waffles every time I have used it and that being said I am sold on this product.  I will be ordering more as we really like how easy it is to make.  I would highly recommend that everyone try this who likes pancakes and waffles it is delicious and very economical.

The waffles come out crisp on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  I've tried other mixes but they do not compare to this mix.  I use the Waring Pro Waffle Maker and my waffles come out beautiful everytime.  I follow the directions on the canister and never have a problem with the results.

It took 3 cups of this mix to make 6 large Belgian Waffles and they cooked to perfection after only 4 minutes!  The flavor of this mix is slightly sweet but there is no aftertaste to it like you get with cheap commercial brands like Bisquick.  I'll be buying more
2020;B001E5E29A;AAJ2P4353LW3K;Christophe Hamann;1;1;5;1271116800;Stonewall Kitchen pancake mix;I received this as a gift a few weeks ago.  It is by far the best home made pancakes I have every had.  The taste and consistancy is excellent.  Blueberries mix very well with this product and the container is desinged to keep the product fresh and not let moths in.  You pay a little more but it is worth it in my opinion

I have allergies to preservatives and to find food in general that is great tasting without the preservatives is a huge challenge. I have tried several other mixes and this one is by far the best. I totally don't understand the reviews about the bad taste and all the chemicals--read labels of other mixes and you will see this one is not full of all those ingredients. There are certain kinds of ingredients that these mixes need

Having these pancakes is like going to a resturant and having exceptional pancakes that you would expect to get at home.  The price is a bit high but you know that before you buy them so its not fair to downgrade the product bnecause of that.<br /><br />They cook up nicely and one pack of two goes a long time.

I did not write this review prematurely as I wanted to give the product a fair chance.  I tried it with whole milk.  I tried it with buttermilk. I tried it with blueberries. I tried it without blueberries.  It is by far the WORST mix I have tried thus far.  The flavor is not good

There were stong overtones of chemical flavors.<br />I will be experimenting with my own recipes in the future.

I like to make my own or get them at the Original Pancake House (which has the best buttermilk pancakes I have ever tasted).  I decided to try this box mix variation even though I am not a fan of box mixes.  The Stonewall brand has a very aromatic scent but that's where I ceased to be impressed.  These pancakes hardly rise at all and have a decent flavor and texture but are nothing to gush over.  Then again I guess I'm one of the few who would gush over a plain bettermilk pancake anyway!!  They're ok but not worth all that money.

2083;B005HGAVGK;A1TPGWR8AZTT9;J. Lewis;2;2;1;1336608000;Not what I ordered.;I got two Teas and one type of iced coffe and the rest were HOLIDAY COFFEES and APPLE CIDER!  Spicy Eggnog? Gingerbread? Bait and swtich.  The only redeeming factor - Amazon was great and issued me a refund.
2084;B005HGAVGK;A2PQZHD03LOEKJ;Pyrmom;2;2;1;1332460800;Extremely Disappointing;There should be an option for a 0 star rating because that is what I would rate this item.<br />First

I overlooked the line stating some flavors may be substituted but one of our substitutions was a hot coffee mix of Eggnog

I find that the price of the water is cheaper from the actual website [...] and I get free shipping.  I feel better overall and wish I could get this stuff by the gallon.  Great Product and well worth the price for the improved feeling of well being.
2116;B00061EXBU;A2C6CB16OESI3D;C. Fontenot;0;0;5;1327968000;Much Cheaper through Penta's Website;You can purchase this for $35.00 including free shpping straight from Penta's Website.<br /><br />I really enjoy drinking this. I can see a difference with my everyday life.

I only gave it one star because i'm so dehydrated from drinking regular water all week because i ran out of money before my penta ran out.  when i can afford another shipment
2118;B00061EXBU;A143VWWW5CGG2S;Richard Lee What Is Hip?;4;12;5;1175040000;To wash my record collection;I bought bottles of this stuff because of its purity.  I have a VPI record washing machine to get the gunk out of the grooves in my record collection.  You basically scrub the records and vacuum the glop off using a mix of water and detergent.  This water is so pure it ever sinks deeper in the grooves and is a visably better penetrating fluid compared to distilled water much less tap (OH NO!) water with all its impurities.  You wouldn't believe how great my records play once they are deep cleaned.  My wife can always tell when I am playing vinyl instead of a CD It just sounds more alive---she says.  This water is highly recommended for this purpose.  I may even drink some of it sometime to see what all the fuss is about.

2120;B0064MEUS6;AQXYD1H2ZQ9NN;Frugalshopper;0;0;1;1327449600;Don't waste your money;The site doesn't list the ingredients for their products online.  Had I known the product was full of trans fats I would not have ordered it.  Watch your labels.  Partially hydrated = partially hydrogenated.  You have to laugh at the ways manufacturers will try to fool the public.  In the future I will not order a product that doesn't list its ingredients online so that consumers can make informed purchases.<br /><br />Did try the product and found it tasteless.  No heat/spice and it left a waxy film on the roof of the mouth

He just munches on them like they are chocolate (or something that one really loves!). I just lay a bunch on his little table and he will just pick them up so fast and as soon as he is done he'll start whining for more. He does not do that with any other snack! It's insane! I have tried them and I must confess they are good

A lot of time I can't find fresh fruit while we are out and about that my son (he is 1) can eat.  These are great because it is actual fruit and he can eat it straight from the pouch.  Just make sure you help them the first couple of times or else you might have a bit of a mess.

Since Amazon has been a five star resource I chose to have Pot Pie shipped. Many of the cans are dented.  So I have to toss them or return. This is a big hassle but would not ever feed a dented can to my beloved boy.  Best to purchase at the pet store

2175;B000LKTDNE;ALSYGPNMPPQ9U;Mythknight;1;2;5;1316044800;Great tea.;Now let me start by saying I did not buy this tea as a diet supplement. I bought this because I tried it from a local store as I was looking for a tea that had some peppermint in it but not so much it was over-powering like a full peppermint tea. This has just the right amount of peppermint combined with a green tea. Overall it is a pleasant taste that I could drink all day.
2176;B002SW7ZOW;ABZZS9PEI350E;Nell From Maryland Jenellew;2;2;4;1294099200;Tastes very good!!!;This tea is very good.  I discovered it while visiting in California. The moment I got home I searched local stores for it and I was not able to find it.  Finally I decided to see if Amazon had it and they did and I bought two boxes.  As long as they make it I will buy it.
2177;B002SW7ZOW;A1RPCL4E65WA4Y;April;2;2;5;1284681600;Wu-yi is;The tea tastes great and helped me curb cravings during dieting. The tea was inexpensive and came packaged in a pretty box. The bags are flimsy
2178;B002SW7ZOW;A2CIIHVCG2FXSP;Yluvamazon Yluvamazon;2;2;4;1268265600;Fine Quality Tea!;I love this TEA. It has a very smooth taste and not bitter like other kind of tea. I do agree that the string seems to come apart easily but I can live with that. No big deal! The quality of TEA makes up for that.
2179;B002SW7ZOW;A3H15E995IH56;Susan Fliss Soapmaker;4;5;4;1274745600;Found at the dollar store;I found this exact same stuff at the dollar store.  It is pretty good.  Not as good or as strong as my loose whole leaf tea
2180;B002SW7ZOW;A19ZAMNNIBACDA;E. Smith;1;1;2;1320105600;Not the same tea...;I ordered through source in the past and cancelled my membership due to the excessive charges every month. I was happy to look on amazon and find that I could purchase for much cheaper and use my prime account. This tea IS NOT THE SAME AS THE ONE THAT CAME IN THE BLACK BOX..The orignal tea is brown and this tea is green...the pamphlet is the same inside as the other and the fragile tea bags are the same but the tea is different. This one comes packaged much preetier but it does not taste the same. I have lost 20 pounds in the last 2 months by drinking this tea in the morning and only water throughout the day that is my only diet change. I used the other tea for a month and half and this new tea for 3 weeks now.. I dont want to stop taking the tea just is in case it is the contributor to my weight loss. The next order I will try the other tea that you have to pay for shipping on. I hope I can find this orginal stuff because this is not it.

Cento actually sells two kind of San Marzano with the same label other than one that says D.O.P. certified. You will receive the one w/o the D.O.P. if you order from Amazon. I have made the mistake in the grocery store not realizing Cento sells ones are D.O.P and ones that are not and did not realize till it was too late. The true D.O.P. ones I have to say make the best sauce! You can taste the difference.

This is false advertising.  If you enlarge the picture shown you can see on the upper left side partially one of the stamps. You will not receive this DOP label.  You will  receive another tomato from somewhere in the region under the Cento name. Typical marketing hoodwinking. Amazon refuses to take returns on this item

It looks like something for a child to play with.  I bought it for my husband to put in his man cave.  He is a huge M&M fan.  I buy him a tree ornament each year from the M&M collections.  I was hoping it had more substance to it.  I also did not realize I was unable to return this item.

This works better than Ibuprofen and is all natural.  After each long run I take a couple tablespoons with my Gatorade and my muscles recover quicker (I experimented with not taking it).  I love this stuff.

As I increased my long runs each week my knees and hips were so sore.  I started to take this cherry concentrate and ever since then I have felt pretty good.  I take the juice every morning with my breakfast.  It has a very strong flavor but mixes well with apple or orange juice.  The half marathon I'm running in is this weekend and I feel ready for it thanks in part to the cherry juice helping reduce the pain.  This stuff works for me.

It is quite refreshing and the flavors are quite vibrant and not weak as in some concoctions.  I happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be distinguished in the mix.  The one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition

First off all it taste pretty good but its kinda sugary and salty. Its an ok drink but when you think about it and you compare it to others this drink is not as healthy as others. Its more like a juice drink than a healthy one. Compared to Vitacoco it has more calories

I was excited to see such a great price on these from a reputable company. These are the best tasting flaxseeds I have ever had.

2576;B000EGX2EG;A2WA0OX8P6NX4P;Sa;4;4;1;1264896000;What is the carbon footprint of this product?;I'm a little shocked that this so-called health food product is made from Chinese grown ingredients.  I'd be curious to see what the carbon footprint of each bite is.  Also keep in mind that Chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products. All the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the United States.  Why not support products and companies who source locally and consider our own economy before we sell out for a slightly cheaper price?  Your purchasing choice does make a difference.  Let's stop expecting corporations and governments to take care of our safety and economy.  They never will.  We can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical well-being. Make purchase decisions wisely.

These taste very crunchy and tasty.<br /><br />Given the kind of unethical food stories we read about China - we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these.  You just cannot import food stuff and sell in the US as gourmet snack food - there needs to be data backing this.<br /><br />Few example of Chinese food (yuk ...):<br /><br />(1) Melamine(kind of platic) in baby food and milk (so wide spread that 80% of milk in China contained this plastic in 2008)<br /><br />(2) Honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin (antibiotic) - because of which it was banned in the US<br /><br />(3) Soy Sauce made from Human hair (not joking google it if you want)<br /><br />(4) Spurious drugs exported to African countries.<br /><br />Need some good facts and quality controls from the Manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls.

The aroma is fantastic and makes you believe you are in the midst of a blooming rose garden. It is a perfect tea to sip in the winter months as it fills your senses with the scents of summer. I bet it would be refreshing as an iced tea with a sprig of fresh mint. Too cold to try that now

I try to stay away from sugar and artificial sweeteners so this was perfect because it contains absolutely no sweetener so I can add my own (mostly liquid stevia).  I also love vanilla flavoring in many things I make so I sometimes use this in place of extract which can be pricey if you use it a lot. For example

Despite being sugar free it has 15 calories per pump and in my opinion needs three pumps to add enough flavor to my iced vanilla lattes. If your going for calorie count this isn't favorable. I would however say if you think other brands are a bit too sweet or if calorie count isn't overly important you should give it a go

I really like it but the real test was my wife's opinion and we also ordered 4 and 1/2 lbs of popcorn from the Boulder popcorn co and the kernels were a little smaller and tasted better. We use coconut oil and it has very good flavor even without butter. I really like the Cambria's Cream kernels the best

The PC is very tasty and light with no residual kernel shells that get stuck in your teeth...4 stars.<br /><br />Problem with using it in hot air poppers is that the kernels are too light and fly out of the machine before they pop.  Tilting the machine helps keep them inside
2732;B003NDA970;A14WXLY4BSE61M;Graymate2004;1;1;4;1217116800;Amish Country Baby White Popcorn;We've enjoyed this popcorn every bit as much if not more than the Movie Theater Popcorn.  It's light and fluffy - tender - and delicious.  I think we enjoy it a bit more because we know there is no palm oil or coconut oil in it - we can control what oils we add or leave out.  It works well with the popper - in fact just last night we had a popper full of this corn and followed it with the other because we had purchased so much of the other - we enjoyed this more.

I received 6 bags the other day and the special popcorn pan from Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country ....GOURMET ... well.. the popped kernels are the size of a pea and with hulls.  It burns very easily.  There are too many old maids due to the delicate nature of the kernel.  I ended up throwing most of the popped corn away.  I am so disappointed in this product.  I now have 5.75 bags of this stuff ... I have nothing good to say about it ... but if you like tiny popped corn with lots of hulls then this may be your product.  I am giving mine to the squirrels.

These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories

We were able to assemble it and have it working within 30 minutes. It worked great as a maternity ward for our alpaca millay and her new cria. We were able to give them some private time while not feeling as though they were separated from the herd. I highly recommend this product and will have many uses for it in the future!

A lot of other truffle oils just have truffle aroma (whatever that is) and a lot of chemicals that sound less than pleasant. You can definitely taste the difference as well.

The throat does heal from this tea. If he starts it after the illness has taken full course

I mainly give them to her right out the package but I've also mixed them into scrambled eggs

They are really handy because I don't use frozen or canned foods because I follow an Ayurvedic diet which prohibits them.  When I can not find fresh peas I have to use these.

I was running plain water through my k-cup maker and using hot cocoa from a canister but my kids didn't really get the right measurements and more often than not we would have overflow. So I decided to try this for my kids and it makes a perfect cup every time. No overflow. The taste is good

These and the Swiss Miss hot chocolate are my favorite K-Cups. And the price of these are the best I've been able to find. My girlfriend and I have already gone through about half of them in about two weeks

Being that I am not a coffee drinker these k cups offer a nice change from tea. The local stores sell this as well but it's half the amount of cups and almost the same price. Buy from Amazon.

No other store can even match that price for Hot Chocolate K-Cups. Your normally going to be paying around $12-$16 for 16 K-cups alone. This package give you 48 K-Cups for a great price.<br /><br />The Hot Chocolate itself is great tasting and can be used on mostly all settings for the B70 except for the travel mug. Low in calories and great tasting. Defiantly a must have if you own a Keurig brewing system!

3339;B005K4Q1VI;AW4RC5QJTVF7N;Kathleen F Celli;0;0;5;1327104000;Best Hot Cocoa;Grove Square is the best k-cup hot cocoa I've tried.  And I've tried a number of the other brands.  This tastes like real cocoa used to taste. And if you add a little milk it's even better. It's so hot from the Keurig that the milk helps cool it down anyway. If your looking for a real chocolate-ly flavor give this a try.

While this milk chocolate k-cup is pretty cheap $12.95 per 24 (54 cents per count) but it is not good. It tasted like watered down chocolate (as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolate/cacao for that matter). This thing is sweet tho

Well this hot chocolate is quite good. The flavor is rich and the hot chocolate has some creaminess to it. I made it for my daughter and toped it off with whipped cream and she loved it.  Will be drinking lots of this on now that it is begining to get colder.

I've tried some other chocolate K-cups and had given up on them since they all seemed pretty watery.  If I can taste water I don't consider it real hot chocolate.  I was pleasantly surprised that this tastes much better than the others I've tried.  (I must admit there are many I haven't tried

Been trying to find a coffee flavor that does that but so far adding these to the coffee has worked out better :-) I usually have 14 oz at a time so I run 4 oz through as hot chocolate and the other 10 as coffee. I did try another brand of kcup hot cocoa and it wasn't as good as this brand.

3450;B005K4Q1VI;A3CAZVZTJ411SB;Twoblueeyesmn;0;1;2;1325721600;Not Good;I read all the reviews on every hot chocolate k-cup on the market and decided to try this one first. Its not good. Even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct plasticy taste. I think that this an inherent problem with all the k-cup hot chocolates. You just can't fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it doesn't taste watered down. I'm going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way.
3451;B005K4Q1VI;AZE0XC66FVSDE;Stephen;0;1;2;1325462400;SoSo;This hot chocolate is ok but not nearly as rich and smooth as the cafe escapes products.  We tried it out because they were less expensive but once they are al gone we'll be going back to the cafe escapes brand.

We've had some of the other brands of hot chocolates and they were good also but just couldn't get myself to pay that much  for hot  chocolate.  The  price was right on these for sure but I was skeptical after reading reviews on the coffees made by this brand.  But it's just hot chocolate so I figured what the heck.  All three are actually plenty chocolaty on the biggest size serving.  Honestly
3464;B005K4Q1VI;A232R554J2QZR1;James C. Boland;5;6;5;1320278400;nice flavor;What I really like about this selection is the choice of three different hot cocoa chocolates.  My favorite is the mint chocolate for it not only tastes like mint chocolate but it has the aroma of a hot mint chocolate.  The milk chocolate and dark chocolate are equally flavorful as well. The price through Amazon is very reasonable.
3465;B005K4Q1VI;A35MXI294400EW;A. Henderson;2;2;5;1328572800;Wonderful!;Very good hot chocolate.  Nice rich flavor.  We used the smallest setting on our Keurig

My wife is a big Swiss Miss drinker and knows her hot cocoa. Not sure I will buy again because of the cost of paying for the k cups. Sometimes I think you are better off buying Swiss Miss packets and just use the hot water function on the k cup machine.

I've tried a couple of different brands and the Grove Square was without doubt the best. I recently purchased a cup of hot cocoa at a local Joe Muggs (in a local BAM store) that was over $2  for the smallest size and really couldn't tell much difference. Obviously every person has different tastes and opinions but so many 1 and 5 star ratings for the exact same product? Oh well

We have 2 boys and got these for them as a snack in lunches etc. I was worried that the product would be stale as stated in other reviews. We've ate 3 boxes and all were fine so far. Kids loved it and I did as well. Prizes were not as good as they used to be but they didn't know the difference. A few were educational and that never hurts! We'll probably order another couple cases. At 40 cents per snack you can't go wrong!

Buell Adirondakdeb;1;1;1;1173484800;Poor Food Design!!!;This product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent Gluten free as well as non-gluten free baking products. DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market

3701;B00113XJQW;A3FMLCPRTRM8KG;Jane Schacher Bird Lover;10;11;5;1231372800;So worth it!;We have a Golden Retriever and had been feeding him the Wellness dog food.  He ate it begrudgingly so we decided to find something else.  I read the ingredients on the Evo red meat and was really impressed.  I gawked at the price but decided cheaper dog food isn't really a bargain if your dog won't eat it or get any enjoyment out of it.  The first time we fed it to him he pretty much inhaled it- and will literally go sit by the bag and look at it like it might just open if he stares at it hard enough!  I agree with the first reviewer that loose stools are a factor but believe with time that will clear up.  He is just so happy that we will keep on buying it for him
3702;B00113XJQW;ATIFO1JHBA8BQ;Ellie A. Creek;5;5;5;1225324800;Great Food!;I have been feeding my GSD the red meat formula for about 6 months and all I can say is WOW. Before I started him on this food he had problems with skin allergies and being picky about food. Although the price for this food is a little daunting it is worth the price! You feed about half the amount you normally would since its so nutrient dense so one bag lasts us almost a month where a bag of purina would last us about 2 weeks. His skin allergies also cleared up in about month and his coat has never looked better and the dandruff is gone too. The only down side is when you first switch over it can cause some loose stools-but it gets better once their digestive system gets adjusted. All in all if you can afford to feed them EVO its well worth the investment!

I dearly enjoy not having to chase them down and make sure that they eat.<br /><br />I have also notice that our older Dane is more active since he has been eating EVO. We feed them a mixture of the Innova EVO Red Meat and Innova EVO Large Bite Dry Dog Food.

The dogs hardly shed at all anymore. No more brushing needed and their coats are very soft and shiny.  We have used other grain free foods previously and liked them but this one is definitely the best we have tried.  It's pricey but we are able to feed them 1/2 of what we were using on the other foods and still maintain the same weight.  This food is well worth the price and the dogs love it.

I was hesitant to purchase these online as they are in glass and are very heavy.  But when there is no other option...  So I ordered 3 jars and they arrived quickly and were extremely well packed.  Not everyone has a taste for the sausages so reviewing that is pointless.  But the company is great to do business with (and they do sell other foods).

What really happened is that each item shipped from a different location and I was charged seperate shipping for each. The shipping was such that I could buy these products more cheaply at the corner drug store. I feel I was misled into overbuying and was left feeling ripped off by Amazon. This is the experience I shared with my friends. After this purchase I bought books from Walmart on line for the first time.

It was without a doubt one of the best coffees that I have tasted.  Very smooth and flavorful.  I would highly recommend this.  After that I ordered a supply from Amazon. They are vacuum packed (I believe much better than store bought coffee).  I may try the decaf version of this to see how that tastes.

On a recent trip to Italy we bought the lavazza rosa espresso and I was able to find it and order it on amazon. I bought the gevalia just to try something new and based on the reviews I thought it might be a good idea. My husband loves it and actually prefers it to the Lavazza.  I just bought another 3 pack. we use a stove top Bialetti and this is fine for that type of maker. Highly recommend!!!

It's as simple as plugging your mic cord into the product and plugging that into your USB. The BEST thing about this product is it allows you to take your mic wherever there is a usb equipped computer. It is light weight so I don't know it's durability and don't plan on throwing it to find out. The Icicle comes with a gain knob which is a plus BUT remember with this is a 60 dollar plug n play tool so it doesn't have any other features.<br /><br />*also i didn't have the noise/feedback issue

It is perfectly easy but I have had nothing but problems from mine. There is a constant popping in anything I record.  I am using an AKG C3000B microphone I have had for a long time and it is in perfect condition so the problem is not with my mic.  Anyone else having this problem?

4087;B001EW5YQS;A2V576O8N1GROI;Roejen;1;1;4;1325289600;Decent price for a good product;Works fine for my Podcasting needs. I use it with a sure SM58 microphone. It is made of plastic and does feel cheap but I have had it for a few months and had zero problems with it. For desktop use it should be fine. Works great for my needs. Wouldn't recommend for heavy use on a stage or being tossed around.

4093;B001EW5YQS;A1OY9LNIROSE3E;Rockmesteady;1;1;4;1300579200;great product! unbeatable price!!;3 years ago I bought a Digidesign 002 protools rack and a lot of other equipment to start recording - but I could never get it to work with my OS on either computer.  I was at an impasse for a long time until I saw this product on Blue's website.  I already had a $400 condenser mic in the closet I had never gotten to use and didn't want to spend more money on a quality USB mic.  I couldn't be happy that this product exists - in it's quality or price!  I noticed no noise or coloration of the signal and it worked without a problem.  It does exactly what it's suppose to do -- act like it doesn't exist.  It just serves it purpose to convert the signal well

4095;B001EW5YQS;A1FUDD4U3S5GCA;Suryakant Sansare;1;1;4;1286928000;works but does not have enough gain;using it for recording vocals on home PC using Shure C606 mic. It is a big improvement over the mic to stereo in for sure.. There is no background noise which was very prevailant in the mic in method. The 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the gain. Even with the gain knob turned all the way up i still had to add gain from my software for the sound to be loud enough. But overall a great product.. do not regret buying it and would recommend it as well.
4096;B001EW5YQS;A23NHZBPOOCCPS;Chris Salazar;1;1;5;1280016000;way better than i thought;ive heard mixed reviews of this.. yeah it feels cheap... but so what?! just take care of it like you would anything like that! and it sounds perfect! i use it to record vocals on logic studio (i get others to sing

The only problem is it acts as a sound card and you can't record and listen to yourself at the same time without latency. This is a deal breaker for me. Blue microphones should add a headphone jack onto the interface so you don't have to listen to recordings through your computer and you can hear your recordings in real time.

4138;B001EW5YQS;A3JL82SR4YHE2R;Jonathan Gill;0;0;5;1291507200;AWESOME! BUY FOR SURE!;I bought the ICICLE because I have been doing a lot of hip-hop vocals and I was using a Samson C01U and the thing with that Mic you can get close to studio but with so much work and you can always tell that you messed with it alot.<br /><br />Well I always wanted to buy a expensive Mic but didnt want to spend $200 more on a USB Pre-Amp so I see this on here the other day and went to Guitar Center and after deciding for a while I went with it. I also already had a MXL V-88 which is a pretty high end condenser mic
4139;B001EW5YQS;A2I8IR1MOR982X;Rielle2173;0;0;4;1282608000;Good;I'm glad i came across the blue icicle (on amazon othere prices where 60 or more) before i went on to buy a mic

I use a low budget dynamic mic and the Icicle gives the right boost for PC recording. I keep the gain at 90 to 100 percent and do volume control on the PC.<br />I see some complaints out there about durability. Keep in mind it is a piece of computer hardware like a modem or an external hard drive
4141;B001EW5YQS;A21SXUZ89SOB9F;Rick W;0;0;5;1270771200;Works Great!;I needed the Icicle to provide better audio quality for recordings I was doing on my PC. I wanted to use my high quality XLR mic for this purpose and found that the Icicle provided far better performance than any other USB mic that I currently owned. I didn't have any problem with the trim pod on the Icicle as reported by a previous review so maybe Blue Mic has corrected that issue.<br /><br />I have and do recommend this to anyone that wants to use their current XLR mic on their PC. The product is great and the price is right.

It's so hard being gluten free so this is god sent for how many things you can make with this. I have celiacs and I haven't had any sort of negative reaction to this. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who can't have gluten but still wants things like pancakes and waffles and donuts and other fun things.

4174;B004391DK0;A2XWNL7JV2VE7;J. Lam;0;0;5;1334275200;Perfect!;We use this mix for pancakes and waffles and it's perfect. We have had a terrible time finding a good all purpose flour that is gluten free (the popular brands taste terrible!) so we tend to use this pancake mix as a base for a lot of our recipes--- including breading for baked chicken and other things. It's definitely best as a pancake mix of course

What I do know it that it is a great option for people trying<br />to eat as normal as possible. This GF option has been a great meal saver for my wife who this last year was diagnosed<br />with Celiac and got sick in tired of tasting gross tasting GF options or super simple meat and vegetables options for meals.<br /><br />We have made all types of breakfast items

I have gone to every grocery in AZ and the cheapest place is Amazon! This is a great product and whatever you make using this flour will taste great. My son has Celiac and is allergic to gluten. I have tried every pancake mix and this one is the one I settled for!
4201;B004391DK0;A1XST2J58SFEPS;D. Willard;0;0;5;1322870400;Delicioso;This is a product that is delicious and easy to use. I made the pancakes with buttermilk and the recipe on the box just said milk. The buttermilk helped make the pancakes light and fluffy. I am a little disappointed that the box will only make one recipe that calls for two cups of the mix. I doubled my recipe for the pancakes which made 14<br />4 inch pancakes.  The recipe says it makes 10 pancakes with 1 cup of the mix. Those 10 pancakes must be silver dollar size.  I am looking forward to making the biscuits so I will have to open a second box to have enough mix. The recipe calls for eggs for biscuits and I never used eggs in my regular biscuits.  I am wondering if buttermilk would make these biscuits rise sufficiently? I have family members who can't eat eggs or milk so I must adapt recipes for them. It is a product I would purchase again. However
4202;B004391DK0;A1NNXX4CL5P952;K. Allen;0;0;5;1322784000;Yummy!;These tasted so good! I was surprised because I have heard so many negative things about glutten free bread products. I would eat these by choice

4207;B004391DK0;A926YP1BSD72Y;Shopper11;0;0;5;1321747200;Gluten Free Pancakes!;I use this to quickly make gluten/egg/dairy free pancakes.  I use rice milk and EngerG egg replacer to make pancakes. They taste pretty good and are a good snack to make for later and store in the fridge.  They're especially good w/either apple butter or peanut butter on them besides the usual maple syrup!
4208;B004391DK0;A1V0BAV1DWIKPQ;Dc Dawg Dc Dawg;0;0;4;1321401600;Solid GF Mix;This stuff is pretty solid. Makes a decent enough pancake for being GF and makes a solid biscuit as well. What we have found works best is taking this mix and using it half and half with the Chebe mix. Between the two it makes for a very nice flour mix. The Chebe is good but on its own tends to be a little squishy

I was able to expand my meal plans and make stuff I thought I couldn't have anymore. I made a pizza with my family all in town using this and then a pizza using a different crust and the whole family liked my bisquick crust better. They said it was lighter and had more taste! I really enjoy finding things that make my crazy diet easier to deal with. Thank you thank you thank you.

Hallman Bornoutofthebox;0;0;5;1301702400;Best all purpose gluten free mix i've tried;Hubby had to switch to gluten free because of gluten intolerance so we tried this and made pancakes. They were great and had sort of a corn bread texture to it. FYI: i made cobbler from an regular bisquick recipe (not gluten free) and the measurements do not transfer. The proportions are different with the gluten free mix so make sure you have the right recipe for what you're making.

There are so many things we can make again now that we have Bisquick!  Not to mention that pancakes finally taste like pancakes again!  How nice to be able to have a biscuit with dinner again!  Since GF products are so expensive the best place to get it is at Amazon on the automatic shipment plan.  It's great!

4260;B004391DK0;A3AATF9L2UGZ2K;Melissa Hammons;25;31;2;1286841600;Not impressed.;I was so excited to get this and try it.  Unfortunately I'm not impressed.<br /><br />For starters the value is terrible.  You get 3 cups of mix per box.  That's enough to make 1 batch of pancakes and 1 batch of biscuits (or 3 batches of pancakes whatever).  For almost 4.50 a box that's not worth it to me especially when the end result is mediocre at best.  For the biscuits I made cheddar biscuits and not even the bread loving toddler would eat them.  The pancakes were okay if I used twice as much real maple syrup as I normally do.<br /><br />The pro's?<br />The biscuits did puff up nicely.  That's the only pro I have.
4261;B004391DK0;A3RBMHU2AGJHXN;Mercy Realms Meg;0;0;5;1295654400;Gluten free with good taste;The best gluten free mix I've tried.  Of the recipes on the box I can vouch for the pancakes and the waffles- the biscuits were edible if not enjoyable.  The pancakes and waffles also freeze well.  I also recommend Betty Crocker's Glutenfree Recipe Collection magazine for extra recipes to try with or without this mix. From the magazine I have thus far made the chicken and dumplings (the dumplings disintegrate a bit too easily but are still good) and the fruit swirl coffee cake (I used a full can of pie filling per 8X8- I used apple and lemon pie fillings.  I thought the cake tasted rather like a cobbler or dry danish pastry).  The mix is quick

4301;B004391DK0;A3QWC3FS4JZMJ1;M. Stuart;7;16;1;1309219200;bisquick not aluminum free;A great idea that falls short. Bisquick gluten-free still uses an aluminum-based baking powder that is toxic to humans. Aluminum lodges in our bodies and has been found in quantities unacceptable in autistic individuals. The company refuses to respond to customer inquiries concerning this. I cannot give this to my family until the baking powder formula has been changed.

Ocallaghan Mickiemo;2;2;4;1318723200;Very tasty biscuits!;Ok--I just bought BIsquick GF and the first thing I tried to make were the drop biscuits (recipe listed on the box).  These are not the kind that are rolled out & cut--these are drop biscuits.  The results were very tasty.  The taste of this GF bisquick is very much like the original

4321;B004391DK0;A3N4JE40O6M0JH;Snmalik;4;5;3;1293494400;An easy solution; but...
4322;B004391DK0;A2VBL3JMMB282U;P. Obrien;1;1;4;1350777600;Pretty Good;I can't say that biscuits made from this mix taste as good as the regular wheat.  But that said

I bought this and it's amazing!  Just like the original Bisquick.  Although it is cheaper at Walmart.

From everything I was reading it seemed daunting to mix different flours to make anything.<br /><br />The boxes are SMALL!  While this mix is okay for making pancakes

4334;B004391DK0;A295HJCIBQR2LB;Jeb;1;1;2;1330128000;Bisquick GF Mix;The pricing is quite a bit higher than in the grocery stores.  It is not available in all stores
4335;B004391DK0;AT673J2WAXDDR;Patty H. Patty H.;1;1;5;1329696000;Good gluten free pancakes;These are really good. I like to make them with a little extra milk so that they are thin. I can't even tell the difference between this and regular pancakes. It's worth the price for my family.
4336;B004391DK0;A1XMRQFTR7VNI3;S. Dietrich;1;1;5;1329696000;Best ever!;We've been using Pamela's for making pancakes and waffles
4337;B004391DK0;AKJVBD10PBMG9;Angy;1;1;2;1325635200;Grainy texture;I am giving this two stars as my family didnt mind the taste but the texture was so grainy and the biscuts fell apart easily. I was not a fan of the pancakes at all I believe they really didnt have a good flavor. Will not be wasting my money on such a tiny package either when you can but a bigger package of regular mix for less? Not fair to us with allergies in my opinion!!
4338;B004391DK0;A1FQNNX80WYWKR;K. Muth Kiari;1;1;4;1324252800;Works like Bisquick;I love that it is mainstream and that it works like bisquick. Not all recipes work the same as regular bisquick though.. so I wish they had more recipes available. It does taste more gluten free than some other options out there.
4339;B004391DK0;ADT7O1C83DE53;Mirawhit;1;1;5;1314230400;Great for cobbler!;1 cup gf Bisquick<br />1 cup soy or almond milk<br />3/4 cup sugar<br />cinnamon to taste<br /><br />Pour over your favorite fruit and bake for for a quick delicious cobbler.<br /><br />Gluten-free Bisquick isn't quite as fluffy and crumbly as the original but it is definitely worth it for the GF crowd.

4343;B004391DK0;A2OE9JUIYO5CNA;Maui Boy;1;1;5;1308355200;Gourmet Pancakes;I was able to use this Gluten free product and make it taste better than any restaurant by bringing the buttermilk to room temperature and separating the yokes from the whites and adding additional baking powder and baking soda to the recipe. I love it. Served with pure maple syrup brings it out of this world.
4344;B004391DK0;A2O2784AUYBQOL;P. Harbit;1;1;5;1308268800;Thank Goodness for Bisquick Gluten free!;My 18 year old son cannot tolerate gluten

4350;B004391DK0;A1W88KUEY9PEYA;Lucy Goosey;1;1;5;1306281600;Awesome!;I tried this today with a recipe from my Bisquik cookbook for a chocolate chip cookie recipe. They came out great! My son who has Autism and food sensory issues came back for seconds. My 16 year old daughter stated they tasted like regular cookies. The recipe was easy but took my whole box of mix. They stayed puffy as I like my cookies that way anyway. I experimented with one tray and refrigerated it. It did not matter other than taking another couple minutes of baking. Will definitely buy this mix again.

4360;B004391DK0;A36KSGO33URJOM;Bookworm;1;1;5;1302825600;Love the pancakes;I just recently bought Gluten Free Bisquick for the first time.  It has been wonderful.  I have to admit that I am addicted to their pancakes. They are so light and thick and fluffy (unlike homemade gluten free pancakes).  They are absolutely delicious!
4361;B004391DK0;A21V83IHNU5J4F;Kreativekid;1;1;4;1301356800;great for pancakes!;This product made wonderful pancakes -- I couldn't taste the difference between this Gluten-Free version and the original. I tried using it to make pizza dough to relative success. The texture was a little bit weird but it tasted good!
4362;B004391DK0;A3AARG5QHVY180;Jj;1;1;5;1298160000;Better Than Expected;I was happily surprised with this product. I read other negative reviews and was honestly disappointed in Betty Crocker gf cake mix so I didn't feel the need to try this. I finally bought it at a whim when I saw it at my local market and I am happy I did. I am a baker at heart and love to spoil my family with homemade deserts and pancakes on the weekends. I have adjusted my cooking and baking to primarily gf for the past year now and am happy when I find a gf alternative that cooks & tastes like the real thing. Another plus is that I can buy this at my local market (which does not carry too many specialty foods) and don't have to make the extra trip to the higher end store.<br /><br />I made pancakes today and they were a hit with everyone. Will definitely use it to try other recipes.<br />Only downside is the cost and size of box

I always preferred Bisquick pancakes over other popular brands through the years.  I am happy to say that I can eat my favorite brand of pancakes again without any health repercussions (gluten intolerant).  My next objective is to make the roll recipe on  the box.  I wish all manufacturers would take note of the rising gluten problem in this country!

It's closer to the botique salsas that have recently appeared with the new taco restaurant trend. It's a little smokey. My picky 3-year old will eat a burrito with this on it. My family always had this (mild) on the table in Southern California and now that I've been transplanted in South Florida I am happy to mail-order. You can get the little single-serve pouches directly from the company

My caffeinated coffee is drunk in the morning... only one cup.  So this coffee is pretty good with evening dessert since I won't get wound up.  Flavor is good

It is smooth and satisfying with a full-bodied taste. My wife and I loved the taste and aroma of this ground coffee. For an ideal cup measure one heaping teaspoon full of coffee per cup of hot water. You could change the quantity depending on the strength of the coffee you desire. I generally drink decaffeinated Folgers's brand

4532;B002TMV3E4;ADY836HK6QSYR;Ardnam Ardnam;0;2;4;1286582400;SURPRISE!;I am not a big fan of decaffeinated coffee--I figure what's the point?  Taste is so often compromised.  I have recently found that caffeine bothers me if I drink it after 7pm so it's decaff or nothing at that point.  Riviera Sunrise tastes like regular coffee.  I was so impressed I decided to try it as my morning coffee.  I expected to have a very negative response to not getting the morning caffeine of my usual coffee but that did not happen.  If you must give up caffeine this is a great solution.
4533;B002TMV3E4;A2PK64OVZA1U8Z;Jakester;0;2;5;1285891200;Exceptional coffee!;I've decaffinated a few times and always find myself returning to caffinated coffee for the flavor.

I love it especially for the fact that I don't feel like a live wire all night from having caffine and the flavor is amazing.  Nothing like a good cup of coffee to make you feel warm and fuzzy after a wonderful dinner.<br /><br />I have tried many different coffee's and have to say this one has a wonderful full flavor without the bite of some of the cheaper coffee's.  Melitta is a great brand and well worth the money.  I also use this to make latte's and it's great.  It's a really fine grind and great for which ever way you prefer to have you cuppa java.  You get what you pay for and this is well worth every penny.

After the pet food issues of a few years ago I switched to only organic dog food for her.  Since she is only 10 lbs the price difference isn't too bad.  I am a free feeder which isn't ideal but means my dog basically has access to food any time she wants it.  Because of this she only gets really excited when people food is offered to her.  Well when I open this bag she comes over and eats asap.  Good enough for me!

We tried pretty much every brand that you can buy in pet shops and always had problems with my dog scratching or having her ears get bright red. We found out the problem after one of the cases where she almost went into renal failure after eating her Milkbone treats. We needed something organic without a lot of beef in it.

Sadly Toffifay is impossible to find depending on where you live. I thought ordering 24 packs would be overkill but I'm going through these things like nobody's business. At this rate I'll have to tack on an extra mile onto my daily running regimen
4892;B0018ATXEU;A765FXDHIRE5M;Ozzy0416;0;0;2;1285372800;toffifay;When I got this it was melted through the package and what wasn't completely destroyed was stuck to the inside of the wrappers.  You would think that if you are going to ship chocolate in the summer time you would pack it in something cold.  I wasn't very happy with it.  I love the candy and once you peeled it off the insides of the wrappers it was good.
4893;B0018ATXEU;A66MSWYTXIB5V;Mark W. Peters;0;0;5;1266969600;Glad to have it again.;This candy has gotten harder and harder to find.  It was down to a couple convienence stores in my area that sold it and they stopped.  Now a year later I typed in Toffifay into Bing and up pops Amazon.  Great price for a great candy and I'm well stocked up for the next 6 months.  The hard part is not eating it all the first week!

4910;B0009JMW1C;A3VBBRHETBOP3Y;B-Ricks;1;1;5;1341964800;Great Stuff;I used it for a sinus infection where I lost my voice completely and had a sore throat. I found this product on yelp and went to an herbal Asian store in Chinatown in Phila. I only paid $2.50! the only difference is that I didn't get tea bags they were dissoluble cubes you place in the hot water. It worked great. It took a few hours to work but it worked!. The next day I had my voice back completely and no sore throat. One night I woke up from terrible post nasal drip cough
4911;B0009JMW1C;A15ZLXABTK8F3F;Lk;1;1;5;1332028800;THIS PRODUCT WORKS!;Its allergy season which usually means large amounts of sudafed.  I don't particularly like the side affects of sudafed and have tried tons of different decongestants.  This is the first thing other than sudafed to actually work!  I have not tried it during a sinus migraine yet but for moderate congestion it works wonders.  Smells a bit off but the taste is just fine.  Make sure to seep it for 10-15 mins or it won't work.  Give it about 10-20 mins to kick in.  Seems to last for 3-4 hrs.  No side affects that I can tell.  So glad to be rid of the racing heart side affect and dry mouth/ sore throat that comes with sudafed.  It works great paired with a sinus rinse or netty pot.

I made up a big tea pot (with 2 tea bags) and let it steep for 15 minutes. I had 2 cups and my husband had one. Neither of us noticed any difference with our sinuses. A few days later I decided to try the tea again. I brewed one cup of tea with one tea bag. I let it sit again for several minutes. I guess the first time I tried it I did not make it strong enough. This time I noticed a difference as my sinuses are a little clearer.

The Honey flavor makes them taste very good and they are bigger and thicker than most others I've seen. The saddlebag package is ingenious. why open and expose to the air all 100 when you only have to open half at a time. leave one half (50) completely sealed. One package of 100 thick beef sticks can sustain someone for a very long time. Use for emergency shelters

Within a month of bottling the Pear Chablis our 30 bottles is down to 6 remaining. We have given as gifts and taken to get togethers. My only negative comment is that the starting Specific Gravity is low therefore these are lower alcohol wines. I did add a couple cups of sugar to the fermenter at the beginning...but worried that adding too much sugar would throw off the flavor of the wine. Anyway

It was originally bought for my wife but then she decided to trade off 15 of these for 15 of the White Zin that we were making for a friends wedding. At the wedding it went quick and many people were asking me to make it for them. MY answer was here is where you buy the kit and if you want to buy it and the bottles I would be happy to make it for you. I do not have a license to sell it since this is just a hobby for me.<br /> I did add one can of white grape concentrate after the F-pack was added and that added so much more flavor.<br /> I promise that you can't go wrong with this kit if you like a sweet chardonnay.

But the packaging it arrived in was in Spanish.  Since I don't speak or read Spanish I was a little leery of this item since it was impossible for me to read ingredients and nutritional information panel.<br />The item is labelled as being made in the USA but the website on the label has a .mx extension for being a Mexican company.<br />I don't have anything against our neighbors to the south.  I just expect that when I buy something on Amazon that the labeling will be in English unless otherwise stated.

They did not work for me so I tried Red Rain which did work and was even cheaper.  Red Rain DID work for me so I am done with 5 hour energy and 6 hour power. The ingredients are pretty close to 5 hour energy but someone is lying since it doesn't work.

I do like the taste of the tropical one the best. They all have different taste but if you want something that is grain free and gluten free then this is the right place. I expected the taste to be different and it is. Other reviewers seem to expect them to taste like oreos or chips ahoy. Of course not.<br /><br />When I eat them

Almost double the price...I don't get it.

I love to have these on hand for they come into play so nicely in so many recipes. Always a joy to have a good crunch in some recipes. One of my favorite ways to use this larger can is to wrap a piece of bacon around them and secure with a toothpick. Then I dip them in a Apricot Ginger marinade and put in the oven until the bacon is crisp. My family loves an appetizer dinner once in a while and this is one of their favorites. Be mindful that this is a larger can so have a couple of recipes in mind for them when opening

I'd like to know more about the process for obtaining this water to understand what the natural coconut water means.  The tasty juicy bits of pulp in the product add an extra complexity and make this a very refreshing beverage.  The fresh coconut is jelly like and not so pulpy

Frantz Tough Sell;3;3;5;1334102400;A tea for the ages...;I wasn't much of a tea drinker until I bought a 'Breville' automatic tea maker and a bag of Tummy Tea Fennel for my wife. She started brewing the first pot of this new tea and did it ever smell great- a little like licorice. We both shared that pot and have been hooked ever since. This is one of those teas that makes you just feel warm and fuzzy all over. It is a feeling you do not forget.  If I was stranded on a desert island and could only have one tea this would be it.<br /><br />  For those who enjoy drinking tea I would encourage you to look into the 'Breville' tea maker. Produced by a German firm it is without a doubt an indispensible tool for brewing tea. The price for this mechanical marvel is a little high but believe me it is worth every penny.

We got his diabetes under control with insulin but I began researching diet information to help us.  All of my research led us to try Felidae grain free.  I spent two weeks carefully switching Louis (and the four girls) from dry Iams to Felidae.  I was immediately able to decrease his insulin and by the time I had him totally on Felidae we were able to discontinue insulin totally.  All with our veterinarian's supervision

I ordered the Felidae last time because the Wellness was no longer eligible for free shipping and the Felidae was - which makes the difference between whether it is a better deal to order it or buy it at Petco brick and mortar....None of my cats will eat it. They actually at NOTHING for the past 2 days since the only thing offered them was the Felidae. I broke down today and gave them a back-up can of 9-Lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now. I think Felidae is a high quality food and I only feed the lower quality grain-free food on rare occasion

Meuli;0;0;5;1321488000;excellent product for your cats;I have the coolest different cats ever-with some exotic in them-and this stuff is amazing and really they seem to love it! It does not make the poo smell bad and the digestive system of some of mine-do not tolerate much grain or gluten so that is VERY much a PLUS!  The price on amazon is better for a large-can (amount / per ounce) than i can find at local pet shops or stores.  So when you can get the free shipping it is REALLY awesome to have pet foods at your door-service too! I hope Amazon will just continue to make pet food / supplies to your home affordable and at a top price!  Sometimes though when i go to try to re order cannot find (the same deals)available.  So I just lurk and watch and wait sometimes til it is Offered again to make it affordable. Not sure why -that happens but i know i have to (watch it) to make sure i don't end up with a high shipping fee in my cart-prior to purchase.

I would also recommend purchasing the 11-ounce cannisters because the coffee is freshest when you can pop open a new can and use it up without refrigerating or freezing it.<br /><br />I do not like many dark roasted coffees because I don't like the burnt taste.  Yuban DARK ROAST has NO burnt or bitter taste.  Definitely shun the regular roast for this one.<br /><br />Also

The cost of the seeds themselves are $1.59 as shown on the package. I couldn't find oat grass seeds at Lowes or my local independent garden center. I'm hoping to find somewhere local to buy them so I can buy more seeds in the future without having to pay a premium and wait for them to ship.
