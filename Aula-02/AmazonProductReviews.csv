The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.

Though I wouldn't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste.  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of.

I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The zero carb sports drinks didn't help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!<br /><br />I've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.<br /><br />These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work.....

I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. Order in cold weather and buy enough to last!!!

She has awful food allergy's and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didn't have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to. She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.. she seems to like that better. We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it. If your dog has allergy's or stomach issue.. or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it! You will see a difference in your pet.

96;B0019CW0HE;A1BFNM27629VAV;E. Triebe;0;0;5;1320105600;Good healthy dog food;I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.

I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion

It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.

This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going. It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong. The stronger it is the less you use as well. The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost. I thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad. This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like.

Haney;2;2;5;1323820800;Great for after lunch;These little guys are tasty and refreshing.<br /><br />I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath.  I eat 2 of these after lunch (because they are so small) and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem.<br /><br />They're sugar free (sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow) which is great and they're tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch.<br /><br />This is a good bulk value buy and I'd highly recommend the mints themselves.  Cheers!

One co-worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes. Like I said

218;B0040WAG7Q;A19SDJ2TSSL8HI;K. Mcgee;0;0;3;1347667200;More Hot/Spicy than McCormick's Brand;My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us. It definitely makes you sweat a bit when you're eating it. It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I don't think I would buy it again due to the heat. We prefer the milder McCormick's brand of Fajita mix. I've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix is.<br /><br />If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag

This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.<br /><br />Let me just say this

The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.<br /><br />I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away. The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally).<br /><br />This is a great tasting tea

I use it maybe once a week at the most. I drink 1/2 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how I feel. IMO this doesn't replace my a.m. coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when I start to fade. Once in a while I drink a full bottle before a workout. I've been drinking Guayaki Yerba Mate teas for years. Compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there I highly recommend this. This product is clean and doesn't leave nasty chems behind in the body. Try it before you judge from a review - everyone's body reacts differently.

It's also nice to have something gluten-free for friends who are borderline diabetic...but I would eat them anyway.

I bought them because brown rice is a good carb.  As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients.  The name is deceptive - these have Masa corn flour listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste.  I won't buy these again - I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste.

That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own

Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour

I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color

But the point is that more than 50% in the bag is over-fried and in brown color. I really suffer eating the over-fried chips. I open some other bags and it looks like the same. So I just throw away all of them. I don't know if I was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same. But for sure I will never buy this brand any more.

These are by far the best.  I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy.  They seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste.

But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.

They are a little lower in fat and sodium than regular tortilla chips.  The flavor out performs any tortilla chip I have ever eaten.  They hold up great to salsas and dips.  Nothing wimpy about them.  I just wish the company made a bigger bag!  Love them.  Usually found in the organic foods section of the grocery

My case of chips came without any packing inside.  All bags in a box with no cushioning at all.  Needless to say most of the chips were broken and I would not order them again.  A great item but if they can't package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money.

Because of the higher price and being sold like a gourmet item I wrongly thought it would be better than the affordable brands sold at the supermarket.  Wrong.

I knew by reading reviews that there wouldn't be enough yellow frosting so I whipped up so edible glue (water and confectionery sugar) to hold the levels of gingerbread that make the pineapple and save the yellow frosting for the outside - this worked great. It was a really fun idea that we enjoyed creating. The licorice was worthless though...

I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found. Which is odd. I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week. I looked everywhere and could not find ont. So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday. I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The gingerbread itself came broken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken. It's non returnable. I called Amazon

The caramel is liquid and complements the Ghiradelli chocolate perfectly. Do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight - you will end up an addict like me.<br />  The Ghiradelli product is far better than the Caramello/Hershey product in every way. The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares

This tea is my daily regular tea. Yunnan is nice in that it will brew dark so you do not need much at a time. It's aromatic and flavorful without any additives. If you want something that is flowery yet more subtle than Earl Grey this Yunnan or a Keemun may be a nice option to explore.

877;B000HDMUQ2;AGC3K4KSI67RI;Joanne Macek;2;2;5;1184544000;Good berry flavor;My son with multiple food allergies really enjoys these bars.  I find that they have a good berry taste.  They also have a nice chewyness.
878;B000HDMUQ2;A30NECNFHHBT3H;Lp;0;0;4;1340236800;great taste But size it smaller;i love them. not too sweet but just right. any allergy free food is great in my book. hope non of these ingredients contains Corn...thats a no no for me too. HOWEVER I DONT APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT I OPENED MY NEW BOX AND THE CUT 1/4 OF IT OFF. IF THE SIZE IT LESS THEN SO SHOULD THE CHARGE. THIS WILL EFFECT MY DECISION IN BUYING AGAIN. I AM NOT A TODDLER I NEED A REAL SIZE BAR PLEASE

Very deceptive advertising.  That and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star.  My 10 year old son ate one and didn't like them. I ate one and agreed as did my husband.  Couldn't give it away!  Everyone has different tastes but these are no tasty treat as far as I'm concerned.

He enjoys most of the Earth's Best foods and we have only found a couple he doesn't eat (anything with too much apple) which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination.

Also I like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste. I just learned this and am telling everyone - only glass recycles forever. And if you don't recycle then you and I have nothing in common and you should stop reading here. It's not even a hard thing to do anymore. Nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy. You just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day. Stop being lazy.

I have never seen it in a tea bag before. I found that to get the taste I remember I needed 2 bags per cup. The bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that I will buy again and again. Plus the shipping time was great.
955;B000S806VM;A2HF72GRWTRW35;James H. Walder Jim Walder;3;3;4;1299196800;sassafrass tea;I grew up in Ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful. I would dig tender roots or bark a few trees for a delightful tea.  I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product.  Not a good bargain.  I switched to Pappy's extract.

960;B000S806VM;A3FIUP4KF49FOH;K;0;0;1;1347926400;K;I first tasted Sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it.  So I started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form.  After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea.  I was told is was Pappy's Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked online and found it at Amazon.com.  As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought I'd order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didn't taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice

You do nothing but mix it with water. Takes only a minute or two. I highly recommend this gravy mix. It will not disappoint.
972;B0002XIB2Y;A1891H0TIXLDXA;Donald M. Bridges;1;2;5;1250294400;Pioneer Gravy is GREAT!;I have used Pioneer Gravy for a number of years.  It is VERY easy to make and tastes great

974;B001EQ4DVQ;AHMCLSA49GPHK;David Boston;7;7;5;1265673600;More expensive online;I am a coffee fanatic but have always stayed away from these because I never liked instant coffee and my assumption was that this would be similar.  I really enjoy the Starbucks VIA instant coffee - but I drink so much
975;B001EQ4DVQ;AXZTWAX77RHPG;William Strickler;3;3;4;1194998400;Very Convenient and far better than instant coffee;I don't think these coffee bags are as good as fresh ground fresh brewed coffee

977;B001EQ4DVQ;A37FCSX7K7GEFT;K. Li;1;1;4;1182038400;Simple. Convenient;I live in the dorms without a kitchen so making a cup of coffee was really easy with this. Especially when I need to stay up late to study or to wake up after 2 hours of sleep. Its just like making tea and tastes decent enough. Not starbucks but good enough with some sugar and cream.
978;B001EQ4DVQ;A680RUE1FDO8B;Jerry Saperstein;0;0;5;1259452800;Brews an excellent cup of coffee quickly and easily;My primary point with this review is to note that this packaging is less expensive than the other size offered by Folger. You get more coffee for less money.<br /><br />  I recently started drinking coffee again after a lapse of many years. Since I didn't know how many cups a day I would use

982;B004DTNJU2;A1C3LSDRPLFZ62;Hank Schwartz;3;3;5;1297814400;new to rooibos tea;I gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit. And I'm glad I did. It has a somewhat sweet and almost minty taste and a wonderful aroma. It has a nice reddish color. This tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green matcha tea I've had
983;B004DTNJU2;A4D9AIUP1NNIY;Hotrod;0;0;5;1341705600;Tasted better than loose leaf rooibos;I tried this before having normal red tea so I waited to review. The flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity. The color is that of muddy water
984;B004DTNJU2;A1YQORA01YBBLS;Md_Jd;0;0;5;1325635200;Best matcha quality and price;I previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price.  I decided to give Pure Matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive.  The quality of Pure Matcha's products surpasses that of all others I have tried- stays fresh

989;B006F2NYI2;A36WE3X9G0DZUZ;Gale P;2;2;5;1324339200;love this hot sauce;I was never much of a hot sauce fan until I tasted Black Market Hot Sauce. I was listning to the radio one morning and the creater/owner was giving an interview

993;B006F2NYI2;AHSURYHM6ZZXC;Nuttmeg;2;2;5;1323734400;Tasty hot sauce!;This is my favorite hot sauce. I buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have. Hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy! My favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far. Thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce!
994;B006F2NYI2;A1KFUVZ3BZ59R1;Merplinger;2;2;5;1323734400;Best all around hot sauce;So far I have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing. My fiance and I use them nearly daily and I just picked up 3 more. It goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kick.<br /><br />The sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears. It is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use. We love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice.
995;B006F2NYI2;A1T5CH6SHV989P;A Biemold;2;2;5;1323734400;best hot sauce around;absolutely love the habenaro sauce...use it on eggs

1008;B006GK4XVA;A3MDETK0D5UAIN;Xoxo Woodfairy;0;0;3;1349308800;Smells like roses but no safety or freshness seal.;The smell at first was just like a bed of fresh roses. Even though the rose content is very minimal I found the smell overwhelming. I did not like that this brand of spices does not have a seal in place and only a loosely screwed on lid. There is no shaker lid either. You open it and it dumps. I am questioning how only a few minute pieces of roses could produce such a perfume odor. I hope it is not chemically enhanced. With the lid being loose and not sealed I have doubts about the safety of the product.

If I wanted a cheap product that I knew was low quality and from China then I would have bought them directly from their site at $7 for 38 of them!!! However

So I rewrapped them using clear bags purchased from Michaels. Also a few were cracked or broken
1180;B00283V4GQ;AJGU56YG8G1DQ;E. Kennedy;2;2;5;1313366400;Very Cute!;I used these and a bunch of other colored lollipops for a friend's birthday and she got a kick out of it.  She had been complaining about feeling old so we threw a kid themed party.  She had a great time.  I don't think it's possible to eat one of these spiral lollipops without feeling like a kid!

I could have saved money by ordering them directly from Oriental Trading Company which is clearly where they came from. they look cheap and they're not as colorful as shown in the picture. the Oriental Trading Company information is on the back of the wrappers on the lollipops. most of the lollipop sticks are bent and two lollipops arrived broken. the box only has 12 lollipops
1183;B00283V4GQ;AV2VEYY6SXUGQ;Ace;1;1;5;1318809600;Great service;I had purchased these to go along with a Candyland costume for Halloween.

None of the lollipops were broken in transit.<br /><br />It turns out the costume I ordered (from another seller) didn't fit at all and was made of very cheap material so I couldn't even alter it to fit.  Since I had to return the costume

The lollipops are 2 inches and I used 1.5 inch thank you stickers on them.  So cute!  The description states that 16 lollipops are included in the order.  I ordered 2 boxes and only received 12 lollipops in each box.  I contacted the seller's customer service.  I received a response and apology right away.  They promptly corrected the order.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive another full box of 12 and not just the 8 I expected.  The lollipops are wrapped in bubble wrap.  Out of three boxes only one lollipop was cracked.  Not a big deal to me since I did receive an extra box.  Great lollipop at a great price.

I have kept them and plan to use again for future parties.  these will  not be consumed so no idea how they taste...

I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons

Two 12 oz trays will be enough for 4 adults so really not worth the money honestly. $10 for two little trays is a lot even for the ease and quality. Like I said they were good and easy to prepare and thankfully only four of us for x-mas dinner today or I wouldn't have had enough. 24 oz. of potatoes sounds bigger then it is lol.

I tried it first hot and then used the remainder for ice tea and both were really good.  The company delivered super fast too which was great.  I recommend this tea highly
1242;B000OK7UDG;A1WFB999A4AQYK;J. Fischer;3;5;1;1252022400;Can't detect the prickly pear;Loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form.  This tea is black tea with prickly pear flavor. The shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea.  If there is a prickly pear component it is all but undetectable when I drink it. It just tastes like regular black tea.  Very disappointing.

Commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted. Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isn't. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste

1371;B0013JQON4;A265ZN83B11MSQ;Tabitha;2;2;5;1338076800;Best for Sweets :];I am a big fan of Sorghum flour for my baked goods. It gives everything a bit of sponge (especially cakes) and adds an extra bit of sweet to the baking. I highly recommend this for baking flour mixes - you may not want to add it to savory recipes though because of the light sweet flavor.

It's cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients. I couldn't believe how she gobbled this up. BUT after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach. Took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days. Her hair also wasn't as soft. This kibble did not do well for her.

No doubt about the quality of the food and my 5 month old dachuhund puppy loves it. But I realized this doesn't have DHA that helps to develop cognitive brain function. Also the kibble might be little big for a puppy. So I believe it's a great food for an adult dog

Pliler;0;0;5;1329004800;Excellent chips;Just to give a little background - I ordered these because they were a great deal for a box of single serving chips and I thought I would give them a try.  The variety of flavors in this package was great and I enjoy most of them.  These chips leave a lot less mess than your average bags of potato chips and there are very few crumbs in the bag.  It is apparent these are not prepared like normal chips and the result is a differently textured chip.  It will be a personal taste as to whether or not you will like the taste and texture

I love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet I have not found a flavor I did not like. Being from England I am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as I would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors I can't complain. I also love the fact that 5% fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack. My only issue now is that I have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as I do. I have now had to go to a box a month but even then I am not sure I can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can.

1632;B001RVFDOO;A1IAM1NQF1CXL7;Lady Di;0;0;5;1315785600;Don't Defeat the Purpose by Eating Two Bags at Once!;I have to watch my calories
1633;B001RVFDOO;A2QVO0RUT9D8JR;Bernadette G. Stephens Honey_In_Houston;0;0;4;1315267200;Great for diet;The product is exactly what it is portrayed to be. Tasty (not yummy) but good. I received the product promptly. I ordered 2 cases and will eat every package.
1634;B001RVFDOO;A2OG042EUQ8XG5;Diane Haynes;0;0;5;1314489600;Best Chips Ever;I love these chips
1635;B001RVFDOO;AHWHI3SPJ2PHO;Ruth Powers Retired Teacher;0;0;5;1313712000;Pop Chips;These are delicious.  My husband and I just love them.  Especially the BBQ and Salt and Vinegar flavors.  I like the individual packages.  It's a wonderful bargain when you get free shipping!
1636;B001RVFDOO;A1HCR858WADMHD;Kstickley;0;0;4;1313712000;A yummy alternative to high-fat chips!;I'm a crunchaholic! I have to have something during the day to crunch! All other chips are so high in fat or sodium that it makes it very difficult to be eating healthy and still get my crunch on. PopChips is the answer and the individual bags are a great way to control your calories too! I highly recommend them all
1637;B001RVFDOO;A6Y6Y1F2APJRS;Jenp;0;0;5;1313107200;yummy popchips;These are the best snacks for me as I am a lap band patient.  They fill u up just enough and the small bags are perfect size
1638;B001RVFDOO;A36EA1M8V6GNPG;K. Lynch;0;0;3;1311724800;Taste yummy but watch out for yeast extract intolerance!;Yum! I had tried the original and the Bar-b-q and really liked them so decided to get the variety pack. For whatever reason the 24 pack is cheaper then the 12. The flavored ones do contain a yeast extract which is similar to MSG and gave my grandmother a bad headache. So if you know anyone that has a sensitivity to MSG
1639;B001RVFDOO;AFZLBRCW8VPPU;A. C. Teeple;0;0;5;1311638400;Love Pop Chips!;A dream for those on Weight Watchers who love potato chips. The individual serving bags of Pop Chips are only 3 points and taste delicious.
1640;B001RVFDOO;A3VIACKGC8CBXV;Carrie Fugett;0;0;5;1311292800;Pop Crisps;These are a Great size and healthy.  They satisfy the craving for something crisp and are reasonable calorie wise.
1641;B001RVFDOO;A3T1FVDD87NYO4;Becky Payne;0;0;5;1311292800;GREAT PRODUCT!;These chips are GREAT substitute for the usual high calorie ones offered!  I keep them on hand to aid in my weight loss venture.
1642;B001RVFDOO;A1PHUCTJ9X9EHJ;Godsambassador;0;0;2;1310860800;Did not care for these. Only liked bbq. Wondering why these are best-sellers;I bought these and tried each flavor. I could not even finish any bag but the barbecue. I really liked the barbecue but all the other flavors were gross. And the texture is really like fingernails on a chalk board to me. HOw is this the #1 best-selling item? Amazed. Anywho to each his own! Godbless and enjoy. But if you are like me and enjoy barbecue just get the barbecue kind!
1643;B001RVFDOO;A5RU262HIHBZC;Suzm Suzm;0;0;5;1310256000;OMG!  So delicious;I can't believe these are actually decent for you.  They taste awesome!  I love these chips
1644;B001RVFDOO;A190F2M4WPMSNZ;Boog;0;0;5;1310256000;great chips;I am on weight watchers and these chips are only 3 points and they taste GREAT.  I like every kind
1645;B001RVFDOO;AVQDEM0DQJC0B;Gary D. Church Pawnman;0;0;5;1304380800;Great product;This is a great product. I was a chip-a-holic and knew I needed to cut back on them. Then I was introduced to pop-chips.I have found my alternative. These chips are great! Low in fats but high in flavor. I purchsed a mixed case with multiple flavors and was not disappointed with any of them. Consider this product for your alternative to the high fat chips available everywhere. I am sure these will catch on and become a big hit.
1646;B001RVFDOO;A2NDW673KP3HSS;Laura Ang;0;0;5;1304294400;they grow on you!;Saw these in Whole Foods and thought they looked interesting. Didn't care for them instantly
1647;B001RVFDOO;A194U71OZ5YTLH;K. Kumar;0;0;5;1304294400;Yummy:);We received our assorted single serve packs today. This is the first time we ordered Popchips. They taste so good. We are already down by 5 packets between adults and kids.<br />Please bear in mind that these chips will in no way compete with regular fried potato chips. The low calories per bag is very much a part of why they deserve 5 stars. I'm sure we will be ordering more. Yay to finding a new healthier snack alternative.
1648;B001RVFDOO;A18GRF94T65X9Z;Reem Chavez;0;0;5;1303862400;Best chips!;I wa hesitant about ordering this product simply because I never ordered snacks of the internet
1649;B001RVFDOO;A1O4QLQRY8GI6T;A. Copper Library Girl;0;0;5;1303171200;Perfect Pop Chips;I am a huge fan of Pop Chips. They had them at my grocery store
1650;B001RVFDOO;A2N3GSVCG76JTB;James Luna The Architect;0;0;5;1303084800;Just my 2 cents...;I have this on a monthly reoccurring purchase making the per unit price even lower that list.  That being said
1651;B001RVFDOO;A1BX4EZ3UGX2HX;Mt;0;0;3;1302652800;Quite delicious but not as good as real chips;Definitely better than Pirate Booty and slightly better than Baked chips. Very tasty but you feel as if you're almost eat something with the same texture as cereal. It's a small payoff to enjoy chips (albeit faux chips). The Vinegar and S/P ones are NASTY!
1652;B001RVFDOO;A39ILC0QR4E09L;A. Schneider;0;0;4;1301702400;Interesting... however I've found something else...;I bought the 6-flavor variety pack.  They are pretty good... nice thing is that I'm not 100% sure if I'm crazy about the texture so by the end of an 0.8 oz bag I don't really want anymore.  However in my quest for different snack foods I found the Food Should Taste Good line of cracker chips.  My money will be spent on those rather than pop chips.  However I think that people should give these a try as well.
1653;B001RVFDOO;AQXYD1H2ZQ9NN;Frugalshopper;0;0;5;1299888000;Love These Chips;The BBQ chips are great.  We liked them better than regular chips.  They have a nice crunch.  Hate Kettle chips which are so hard that they are like eating shards of glass.<br /><br />We will definitely be buying more of the Popchips.
1654;B001RVFDOO;A2MW2W7H1DUOF8;Sven The Educated;0;0;5;1299801600;tast great less lard.;These really are good I gave some to other people and they liked them too. The plain flavored ones take well to using them as scoops for your own dip or salsa. When eating the BBq flavored ones brings back memories of yester years when I would eat BBq pork skins while riding in the back of the truck on the range. I think the pepper ones could use more pepper but they are all still good and make a good snack or side dish to lunch at 100 Cal per pack.
1655;B001RVFDOO;A9CGRZG2ISSC9;Angela Campana Gella;0;0;5;1299110400;OMG!!!! The Best Snack Ever!!!;To those of you

1660;B001RVFDOO;A26H90YYINQRR1;Jean Page;0;0;5;1297468800;The Snacker;My whole family loves these chips.  I am following the Weight Watchers plan and the whole bag is only 3 points

1665;B001RVFDOO;A36WJIKDKQDA05;E. A. Heckman Eilene;0;0;5;1296432000;Tasty!;I bought these when they were on a Gold Box deal...thinking that it would be a nice inexpensive toss in for a month of lunches...and then I'd never buy them again.<br /><br />Not so...<br /><br />They're actually really tasty!  Exceptionally crunchy!  And the flavor is similar to kettle cooked chips.  Definitely going on subscribe and save for a while.<br /><br />I don't think they're any more salty than standard potato chips...but they're by no means low salt.
1666;B001RVFDOO;A1EDX1UZ64LA7J;Dawne;0;0;5;1296259200;Topchips!;Popchips are a great guilt-free way to add some crunchy satisfaction to your diet without added excess fat and sugar. They are clean

1816;B001RVFDOO;A2RL1RS6PWUHWI;Jennifer Ackerman;2;2;2;1336608000;Too strong of flavors;I love shrimp chips and I love healthier alternatives as well so I thought these would be a match made in heaven. Not so much. The flavors were too strong most of the time (I am a huge fan of pepper but even I had a hard time enjoying the salt & pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is -- and this is from someone who currently lives in the UK and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here) and too bleh in others. The only flavors that my husband and I both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again.<br /><br />I wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say
1817;B001RVFDOO;A1CSPUEJPB8ZDD;Sam;2;2;3;1330128000;If you're expecting full chip flavor reconsider getting another brand of chips.;I expected from the extremely positive reviews on the site for full flavor healty chips. In reality I get an OKAY taste with a strange aftertaste on basically all of the flavors. Chedder and Salt&Pepper honestly being some of the worst tasting chips I've ever had. If you're just looking for a great tasting brand of chips with health as a #2 on the list there are much much better brands out there. In the end I compare these chips to diet soda vs regular
1818;B001RVFDOO;A364Z8P1YEV5NS;K. Pollock;2;2;5;1316649600;Great for losing weight!;I ordered these chips because they got so many good reviews and I'm so glad I did.<br />All of the flavors are tasty and satisfying. At 100 calories a bag

1821;B001RVFDOO;AH4GXZ45GSP54;Henryy;2;2;3;1286841600;Tasty but Salty;So for a healthier snack it sure is salty. But then the salt is a way for them to make the chips taste better without additional calories. Each bag is 100 calories with 10% sodium intake for the day.<br /><br />The chips are not bad

It was nothing like what I expected (granted that I expected good old kettle cooked potato chips). I bought the 6-flavor variety pack and there were many flavors I did not care for. It was worth trying them but I am not going to purchase them again in the future.

The most important part to being on weight watchers is too find food items that let you feel like your not giving anything up.  Popchips do that for me.  They are only 2 points plus on weight watcher's.  They go great with every meal (salad

(While you can);I had seen these advertised on the Hungry Girl website but was not big on buying an expensive potato chip.  I was given a free bag at some event & found them to be tasty.  The single serve bags in the grocery store were $1 for a 0.8 oz bag.  Buy them from here and they are $21 for 24 1 oz bags. (Same amount of Weight Watchers points.) If you get two cases

BBq to salty but if you like a little twang its ok. according to the family. Plain is horrible. Salt and vinegar was the best overall. My family gave it 3 stars i will stick to kettle chips-

I hate spending money on herbs just to use a little and have the rest go bad shortly after.  I put some herbs (mostly basil) in here and they were fresh for a few weeks!  No leakage probs either

1923;B0016PKA1C;A3SKJR85RGGZG7;Goosedude Goosedude;1;1;3;1300665600;Would be a great product....if it was easier to open;I got one of these for XMAS...and to be honest it does work well and does extend the life of your fresh herbs while providing an attractive container.<br /><br />The main problem is the container is difficult to open. It does get easier over time but whoever designed this thing should not have made it so hard from the get go.<br /><br />The thing is its very easy to open when there is nothing inside it as you can you use as much force as needed open it (you don't need to open the bottom....just squeeze the sides and pull the plastic cover up and out FIRMLY). Don't worry...you won't break it. It is pretty sturdy plastic.<br /><br />The real issue is when it is filled or has water in it...its difficult to use that much force and popping it open without spilling.<br /><br />I've just resorted to emptying the water reservoir through its fill port....then popping it.<br /><br />PREPARA...please read these reviews and improve on the next design!!!

Disappointing;I've been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herb/vegetable/salad bins inside to grow vegetables and I thought the Prepara Herb Savor Pod looked like the perfect precursor. Wrong. The detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere. Similarly

1936;B000F4EU52;A38DUAG2FRUMBK;David Daniel;8;9;1;1244073600;Not Safe!;After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there. I would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health!

In particular I adore papayas and mangos.  The fruit juice instead of syrup is also very nice.  The easy pull-top on the can makes this a great item to stash in my desk drawer at work

2008;B001E5E29A;A2C0EA9W5M7HEL;Diane Arnett Mifelizdia;1;1;5;1331078400;BEST PANCAKES OF MY LIFE;These pancakes just hit the spot and make me feel like I am eating a restaurant breakfast at home for a lot less money. Splurge on this and the good maple syrup...it really is cheaper than going to Denny's or IHOP where a meal for two will be $20 minimum.
2009;B001E5E29A;A2H5ZMH5TFB9GK;Hrvats;1;1;4;1316304000;pretty darn good but at an increased cost;Let me start by saying my family loves this stuff.  It has a fairly strong flavor of vanilla.  It cooks up nicce and light.  My problem with this product is the recent price increase.  It was a good product at a fair price but now it is pricey.  All-in-all I would suggest that you order this at least once to taste what good pancakes are supposed to taste like.  After that I would suggest playing with recepies on your own.

Somehow Hungry Jack felt like an afront to such a sublime kitchen appliance. I read the reviews here on Amazon and concluded that despite the rather high price

2013;B001E5E29A;A1IH5YW0X6DE26;Deb;1;1;4;1302393600;A great backup from scratch;This is the pancake mix we go to when we don't have buttermilk in the fridge (don't think the vinegar trick is worth it so we always do fresh) to make Alton Brown's buttermilk pancake recipe.  This Stonewall mix is a good option and the flavor is the best of any store bought mix by far! It might cost more

It makes the best waffles every time I have used it and that being said I am sold on this product.  I will be ordering more as we really like how easy it is to make.  I would highly recommend that everyone try this who likes pancakes and waffles it is delicious and very economical.

The waffles come out crisp on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  I've tried other mixes but they do not compare to this mix.  I use the Waring Pro Waffle Maker and my waffles come out beautiful everytime.  I follow the directions on the canister and never have a problem with the results.

It took 3 cups of this mix to make 6 large Belgian Waffles and they cooked to perfection after only 4 minutes!  The flavor of this mix is slightly sweet but there is no aftertaste to it like you get with cheap commercial brands like Bisquick.  I'll be buying more
2020;B001E5E29A;AAJ2P4353LW3K;Christophe Hamann;1;1;5;1271116800;Stonewall Kitchen pancake mix;I received this as a gift a few weeks ago.  It is by far the best home made pancakes I have every had.  The taste and consistancy is excellent.  Blueberries mix very well with this product and the container is desinged to keep the product fresh and not let moths in.  You pay a little more but it is worth it in my opinion

I have allergies to preservatives and to find food in general that is great tasting without the preservatives is a huge challenge. I have tried several other mixes and this one is by far the best. I totally don't understand the reviews about the bad taste and all the chemicals--read labels of other mixes and you will see this one is not full of all those ingredients. There are certain kinds of ingredients that these mixes need

Having these pancakes is like going to a resturant and having exceptional pancakes that you would expect to get at home.  The price is a bit high but you know that before you buy them so its not fair to downgrade the product bnecause of that.<br /><br />They cook up nicely and one pack of two goes a long time.

I did not write this review prematurely as I wanted to give the product a fair chance.  I tried it with whole milk.  I tried it with buttermilk. I tried it with blueberries. I tried it without blueberries.  It is by far the WORST mix I have tried thus far.  The flavor is not good

There were stong overtones of chemical flavors.<br />I will be experimenting with my own recipes in the future.

I like to make my own or get them at the Original Pancake House (which has the best buttermilk pancakes I have ever tasted).  I decided to try this box mix variation even though I am not a fan of box mixes.  The Stonewall brand has a very aromatic scent but that's where I ceased to be impressed.  These pancakes hardly rise at all and have a decent flavor and texture but are nothing to gush over.  Then again I guess I'm one of the few who would gush over a plain bettermilk pancake anyway!!  They're ok but not worth all that money.

2083;B005HGAVGK;A1TPGWR8AZTT9;J. Lewis;2;2;1;1336608000;Not what I ordered.;I got two Teas and one type of iced coffe and the rest were HOLIDAY COFFEES and APPLE CIDER!  Spicy Eggnog? Gingerbread? Bait and swtich.  The only redeeming factor - Amazon was great and issued me a refund.
2084;B005HGAVGK;A2PQZHD03LOEKJ;Pyrmom;2;2;1;1332460800;Extremely Disappointing;There should be an option for a 0 star rating because that is what I would rate this item.<br />First

I overlooked the line stating some flavors may be substituted but one of our substitutions was a hot coffee mix of Eggnog

I find that the price of the water is cheaper from the actual website [...] and I get free shipping.  I feel better overall and wish I could get this stuff by the gallon.  Great Product and well worth the price for the improved feeling of well being.
2116;B00061EXBU;A2C6CB16OESI3D;C. Fontenot;0;0;5;1327968000;Much Cheaper through Penta's Website;You can purchase this for $35.00 including free shpping straight from Penta's Website.<br /><br />I really enjoy drinking this. I can see a difference with my everyday life.

I only gave it one star because i'm so dehydrated from drinking regular water all week because i ran out of money before my penta ran out.  when i can afford another shipment
2118;B00061EXBU;A143VWWW5CGG2S;Richard Lee What Is Hip?;4;12;5;1175040000;To wash my record collection;I bought bottles of this stuff because of its purity.  I have a VPI record washing machine to get the gunk out of the grooves in my record collection.  You basically scrub the records and vacuum the glop off using a mix of water and detergent.  This water is so pure it ever sinks deeper in the grooves and is a visably better penetrating fluid compared to distilled water much less tap (OH NO!) water with all its impurities.  You wouldn't believe how great my records play once they are deep cleaned.  My wife can always tell when I am playing vinyl instead of a CD It just sounds more alive---she says.  This water is highly recommended for this purpose.  I may even drink some of it sometime to see what all the fuss is about.

2120;B0064MEUS6;AQXYD1H2ZQ9NN;Frugalshopper;0;0;1;1327449600;Don't waste your money;The site doesn't list the ingredients for their products online.  Had I known the product was full of trans fats I would not have ordered it.  Watch your labels.  Partially hydrated = partially hydrogenated.  You have to laugh at the ways manufacturers will try to fool the public.  In the future I will not order a product that doesn't list its ingredients online so that consumers can make informed purchases.<br /><br />Did try the product and found it tasteless.  No heat/spice and it left a waxy film on the roof of the mouth

He just munches on them like they are chocolate (or something that one really loves!). I just lay a bunch on his little table and he will just pick them up so fast and as soon as he is done he'll start whining for more. He does not do that with any other snack! It's insane! I have tried them and I must confess they are good

A lot of time I can't find fresh fruit while we are out and about that my son (he is 1) can eat.  These are great because it is actual fruit and he can eat it straight from the pouch.  Just make sure you help them the first couple of times or else you might have a bit of a mess.

Since Amazon has been a five star resource I chose to have Pot Pie shipped. Many of the cans are dented.  So I have to toss them or return. This is a big hassle but would not ever feed a dented can to my beloved boy.  Best to purchase at the pet store

2175;B000LKTDNE;ALSYGPNMPPQ9U;Mythknight;1;2;5;1316044800;Great tea.;Now let me start by saying I did not buy this tea as a diet supplement. I bought this because I tried it from a local store as I was looking for a tea that had some peppermint in it but not so much it was over-powering like a full peppermint tea. This has just the right amount of peppermint combined with a green tea. Overall it is a pleasant taste that I could drink all day.
2176;B002SW7ZOW;ABZZS9PEI350E;Nell From Maryland Jenellew;2;2;4;1294099200;Tastes very good!!!;This tea is very good.  I discovered it while visiting in California. The moment I got home I searched local stores for it and I was not able to find it.  Finally I decided to see if Amazon had it and they did and I bought two boxes.  As long as they make it I will buy it.
2177;B002SW7ZOW;A1RPCL4E65WA4Y;April;2;2;5;1284681600;Wu-yi is;The tea tastes great and helped me curb cravings during dieting. The tea was inexpensive and came packaged in a pretty box. The bags are flimsy
2178;B002SW7ZOW;A2CIIHVCG2FXSP;Yluvamazon Yluvamazon;2;2;4;1268265600;Fine Quality Tea!;I love this TEA. It has a very smooth taste and not bitter like other kind of tea. I do agree that the string seems to come apart easily but I can live with that. No big deal! The quality of TEA makes up for that.
2179;B002SW7ZOW;A3H15E995IH56;Susan Fliss Soapmaker;4;5;4;1274745600;Found at the dollar store;I found this exact same stuff at the dollar store.  It is pretty good.  Not as good or as strong as my loose whole leaf tea
2180;B002SW7ZOW;A19ZAMNNIBACDA;E. Smith;1;1;2;1320105600;Not the same tea...;I ordered through source in the past and cancelled my membership due to the excessive charges every month. I was happy to look on amazon and find that I could purchase for much cheaper and use my prime account. This tea IS NOT THE SAME AS THE ONE THAT CAME IN THE BLACK BOX..The orignal tea is brown and this tea is green...the pamphlet is the same inside as the other and the fragile tea bags are the same but the tea is different. This one comes packaged much preetier but it does not taste the same. I have lost 20 pounds in the last 2 months by drinking this tea in the morning and only water throughout the day that is my only diet change. I used the other tea for a month and half and this new tea for 3 weeks now.. I dont want to stop taking the tea just is in case it is the contributor to my weight loss. The next order I will try the other tea that you have to pay for shipping on. I hope I can find this orginal stuff because this is not it.

Cento actually sells two kind of San Marzano with the same label other than one that says D.O.P. certified. You will receive the one w/o the D.O.P. if you order from Amazon. I have made the mistake in the grocery store not realizing Cento sells ones are D.O.P and ones that are not and did not realize till it was too late. The true D.O.P. ones I have to say make the best sauce! You can taste the difference.

This is false advertising.  If you enlarge the picture shown you can see on the upper left side partially one of the stamps. You will not receive this DOP label.  You will  receive another tomato from somewhere in the region under the Cento name. Typical marketing hoodwinking. Amazon refuses to take returns on this item

It looks like something for a child to play with.  I bought it for my husband to put in his man cave.  He is a huge M&M fan.  I buy him a tree ornament each year from the M&M collections.  I was hoping it had more substance to it.  I also did not realize I was unable to return this item.

This works better than Ibuprofen and is all natural.  After each long run I take a couple tablespoons with my Gatorade and my muscles recover quicker (I experimented with not taking it).  I love this stuff.

As I increased my long runs each week my knees and hips were so sore.  I started to take this cherry concentrate and ever since then I have felt pretty good.  I take the juice every morning with my breakfast.  It has a very strong flavor but mixes well with apple or orange juice.  The half marathon I'm running in is this weekend and I feel ready for it thanks in part to the cherry juice helping reduce the pain.  This stuff works for me.

It is quite refreshing and the flavors are quite vibrant and not weak as in some concoctions.  I happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be distinguished in the mix.  The one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition

First off all it taste pretty good but its kinda sugary and salty. Its an ok drink but when you think about it and you compare it to others this drink is not as healthy as others. Its more like a juice drink than a healthy one. Compared to Vitacoco it has more calories

I was excited to see such a great price on these from a reputable company. These are the best tasting flaxseeds I have ever had.

2576;B000EGX2EG;A2WA0OX8P6NX4P;Sa;4;4;1;1264896000;What is the carbon footprint of this product?;I'm a little shocked that this so-called health food product is made from Chinese grown ingredients.  I'd be curious to see what the carbon footprint of each bite is.  Also keep in mind that Chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products. All the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the United States.  Why not support products and companies who source locally and consider our own economy before we sell out for a slightly cheaper price?  Your purchasing choice does make a difference.  Let's stop expecting corporations and governments to take care of our safety and economy.  They never will.  We can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical well-being. Make purchase decisions wisely.

These taste very crunchy and tasty.<br /><br />Given the kind of unethical food stories we read about China - we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these.  You just cannot import food stuff and sell in the US as gourmet snack food - there needs to be data backing this.<br /><br />Few example of Chinese food (yuk ...):<br /><br />(1) Melamine(kind of platic) in baby food and milk (so wide spread that 80% of milk in China contained this plastic in 2008)<br /><br />(2) Honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin (antibiotic) - because of which it was banned in the US<br /><br />(3) Soy Sauce made from Human hair (not joking google it if you want)<br /><br />(4) Spurious drugs exported to African countries.<br /><br />Need some good facts and quality controls from the Manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls.

The aroma is fantastic and makes you believe you are in the midst of a blooming rose garden. It is a perfect tea to sip in the winter months as it fills your senses with the scents of summer. I bet it would be refreshing as an iced tea with a sprig of fresh mint. Too cold to try that now

I try to stay away from sugar and artificial sweeteners so this was perfect because it contains absolutely no sweetener so I can add my own (mostly liquid stevia).  I also love vanilla flavoring in many things I make so I sometimes use this in place of extract which can be pricey if you use it a lot. For example

Despite being sugar free it has 15 calories per pump and in my opinion needs three pumps to add enough flavor to my iced vanilla lattes. If your going for calorie count this isn't favorable. I would however say if you think other brands are a bit too sweet or if calorie count isn't overly important you should give it a go

I really like it but the real test was my wife's opinion and we also ordered 4 and 1/2 lbs of popcorn from the Boulder popcorn co and the kernels were a little smaller and tasted better. We use coconut oil and it has very good flavor even without butter. I really like the Cambria's Cream kernels the best

The PC is very tasty and light with no residual kernel shells that get stuck in your teeth...4 stars.<br /><br />Problem with using it in hot air poppers is that the kernels are too light and fly out of the machine before they pop.  Tilting the machine helps keep them inside
2732;B003NDA970;A14WXLY4BSE61M;Graymate2004;1;1;4;1217116800;Amish Country Baby White Popcorn;We've enjoyed this popcorn every bit as much if not more than the Movie Theater Popcorn.  It's light and fluffy - tender - and delicious.  I think we enjoy it a bit more because we know there is no palm oil or coconut oil in it - we can control what oils we add or leave out.  It works well with the popper - in fact just last night we had a popper full of this corn and followed it with the other because we had purchased so much of the other - we enjoyed this more.

I received 6 bags the other day and the special popcorn pan from Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country ....GOURMET ... well.. the popped kernels are the size of a pea and with hulls.  It burns very easily.  There are too many old maids due to the delicate nature of the kernel.  I ended up throwing most of the popped corn away.  I am so disappointed in this product.  I now have 5.75 bags of this stuff ... I have nothing good to say about it ... but if you like tiny popped corn with lots of hulls then this may be your product.  I am giving mine to the squirrels.

These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories

We were able to assemble it and have it working within 30 minutes. It worked great as a maternity ward for our alpaca millay and her new cria. We were able to give them some private time while not feeling as though they were separated from the herd. I highly recommend this product and will have many uses for it in the future!

A lot of other truffle oils just have truffle aroma (whatever that is) and a lot of chemicals that sound less than pleasant. You can definitely taste the difference as well.

The throat does heal from this tea. If he starts it after the illness has taken full course

I mainly give them to her right out the package but I've also mixed them into scrambled eggs

They are really handy because I don't use frozen or canned foods because I follow an Ayurvedic diet which prohibits them.  When I can not find fresh peas I have to use these.

I was running plain water through my k-cup maker and using hot cocoa from a canister but my kids didn't really get the right measurements and more often than not we would have overflow. So I decided to try this for my kids and it makes a perfect cup every time. No overflow. The taste is good

These and the Swiss Miss hot chocolate are my favorite K-Cups. And the price of these are the best I've been able to find. My girlfriend and I have already gone through about half of them in about two weeks

Being that I am not a coffee drinker these k cups offer a nice change from tea. The local stores sell this as well but it's half the amount of cups and almost the same price. Buy from Amazon.

No other store can even match that price for Hot Chocolate K-Cups. Your normally going to be paying around $12-$16 for 16 K-cups alone. This package give you 48 K-Cups for a great price.<br /><br />The Hot Chocolate itself is great tasting and can be used on mostly all settings for the B70 except for the travel mug. Low in calories and great tasting. Defiantly a must have if you own a Keurig brewing system!

3339;B005K4Q1VI;AW4RC5QJTVF7N;Kathleen F Celli;0;0;5;1327104000;Best Hot Cocoa;Grove Square is the best k-cup hot cocoa I've tried.  And I've tried a number of the other brands.  This tastes like real cocoa used to taste. And if you add a little milk it's even better. It's so hot from the Keurig that the milk helps cool it down anyway. If your looking for a real chocolate-ly flavor give this a try.

While this milk chocolate k-cup is pretty cheap $12.95 per 24 (54 cents per count) but it is not good. It tasted like watered down chocolate (as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolate/cacao for that matter). This thing is sweet tho

Well this hot chocolate is quite good. The flavor is rich and the hot chocolate has some creaminess to it. I made it for my daughter and toped it off with whipped cream and she loved it.  Will be drinking lots of this on now that it is begining to get colder.

I've tried some other chocolate K-cups and had given up on them since they all seemed pretty watery.  If I can taste water I don't consider it real hot chocolate.  I was pleasantly surprised that this tastes much better than the others I've tried.  (I must admit there are many I haven't tried

Been trying to find a coffee flavor that does that but so far adding these to the coffee has worked out better :-) I usually have 14 oz at a time so I run 4 oz through as hot chocolate and the other 10 as coffee. I did try another brand of kcup hot cocoa and it wasn't as good as this brand.

3450;B005K4Q1VI;A3CAZVZTJ411SB;Twoblueeyesmn;0;1;2;1325721600;Not Good;I read all the reviews on every hot chocolate k-cup on the market and decided to try this one first. Its not good. Even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct plasticy taste. I think that this an inherent problem with all the k-cup hot chocolates. You just can't fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it doesn't taste watered down. I'm going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way.
3451;B005K4Q1VI;AZE0XC66FVSDE;Stephen;0;1;2;1325462400;SoSo;This hot chocolate is ok but not nearly as rich and smooth as the cafe escapes products.  We tried it out because they were less expensive but once they are al gone we'll be going back to the cafe escapes brand.

We've had some of the other brands of hot chocolates and they were good also but just couldn't get myself to pay that much  for hot  chocolate.  The  price was right on these for sure but I was skeptical after reading reviews on the coffees made by this brand.  But it's just hot chocolate so I figured what the heck.  All three are actually plenty chocolaty on the biggest size serving.  Honestly
3464;B005K4Q1VI;A232R554J2QZR1;James C. Boland;5;6;5;1320278400;nice flavor;What I really like about this selection is the choice of three different hot cocoa chocolates.  My favorite is the mint chocolate for it not only tastes like mint chocolate but it has the aroma of a hot mint chocolate.  The milk chocolate and dark chocolate are equally flavorful as well. The price through Amazon is very reasonable.
3465;B005K4Q1VI;A35MXI294400EW;A. Henderson;2;2;5;1328572800;Wonderful!;Very good hot chocolate.  Nice rich flavor.  We used the smallest setting on our Keurig

My wife is a big Swiss Miss drinker and knows her hot cocoa. Not sure I will buy again because of the cost of paying for the k cups. Sometimes I think you are better off buying Swiss Miss packets and just use the hot water function on the k cup machine.

I've tried a couple of different brands and the Grove Square was without doubt the best. I recently purchased a cup of hot cocoa at a local Joe Muggs (in a local BAM store) that was over $2  for the smallest size and really couldn't tell much difference. Obviously every person has different tastes and opinions but so many 1 and 5 star ratings for the exact same product? Oh well

We have 2 boys and got these for them as a snack in lunches etc. I was worried that the product would be stale as stated in other reviews. We've ate 3 boxes and all were fine so far. Kids loved it and I did as well. Prizes were not as good as they used to be but they didn't know the difference. A few were educational and that never hurts! We'll probably order another couple cases. At 40 cents per snack you can't go wrong!

Buell Adirondakdeb;1;1;1;1173484800;Poor Food Design!!!;This product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent Gluten free as well as non-gluten free baking products. DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market

3701;B00113XJQW;A3FMLCPRTRM8KG;Jane Schacher Bird Lover;10;11;5;1231372800;So worth it!;We have a Golden Retriever and had been feeding him the Wellness dog food.  He ate it begrudgingly so we decided to find something else.  I read the ingredients on the Evo red meat and was really impressed.  I gawked at the price but decided cheaper dog food isn't really a bargain if your dog won't eat it or get any enjoyment out of it.  The first time we fed it to him he pretty much inhaled it- and will literally go sit by the bag and look at it like it might just open if he stares at it hard enough!  I agree with the first reviewer that loose stools are a factor but believe with time that will clear up.  He is just so happy that we will keep on buying it for him
3702;B00113XJQW;ATIFO1JHBA8BQ;Ellie A. Creek;5;5;5;1225324800;Great Food!;I have been feeding my GSD the red meat formula for about 6 months and all I can say is WOW. Before I started him on this food he had problems with skin allergies and being picky about food. Although the price for this food is a little daunting it is worth the price! You feed about half the amount you normally would since its so nutrient dense so one bag lasts us almost a month where a bag of purina would last us about 2 weeks. His skin allergies also cleared up in about month and his coat has never looked better and the dandruff is gone too. The only down side is when you first switch over it can cause some loose stools-but it gets better once their digestive system gets adjusted. All in all if you can afford to feed them EVO its well worth the investment!

I dearly enjoy not having to chase them down and make sure that they eat.<br /><br />I have also notice that our older Dane is more active since he has been eating EVO. We feed them a mixture of the Innova EVO Red Meat and Innova EVO Large Bite Dry Dog Food.

The dogs hardly shed at all anymore. No more brushing needed and their coats are very soft and shiny.  We have used other grain free foods previously and liked them but this one is definitely the best we have tried.  It's pricey but we are able to feed them 1/2 of what we were using on the other foods and still maintain the same weight.  This food is well worth the price and the dogs love it.

I was hesitant to purchase these online as they are in glass and are very heavy.  But when there is no other option...  So I ordered 3 jars and they arrived quickly and were extremely well packed.  Not everyone has a taste for the sausages so reviewing that is pointless.  But the company is great to do business with (and they do sell other foods).

What really happened is that each item shipped from a different location and I was charged seperate shipping for each. The shipping was such that I could buy these products more cheaply at the corner drug store. I feel I was misled into overbuying and was left feeling ripped off by Amazon. This is the experience I shared with my friends. After this purchase I bought books from Walmart on line for the first time.

It was without a doubt one of the best coffees that I have tasted.  Very smooth and flavorful.  I would highly recommend this.  After that I ordered a supply from Amazon. They are vacuum packed (I believe much better than store bought coffee).  I may try the decaf version of this to see how that tastes.

On a recent trip to Italy we bought the lavazza rosa espresso and I was able to find it and order it on amazon. I bought the gevalia just to try something new and based on the reviews I thought it might be a good idea. My husband loves it and actually prefers it to the Lavazza.  I just bought another 3 pack. we use a stove top Bialetti and this is fine for that type of maker. Highly recommend!!!

It's as simple as plugging your mic cord into the product and plugging that into your USB. The BEST thing about this product is it allows you to take your mic wherever there is a usb equipped computer. It is light weight so I don't know it's durability and don't plan on throwing it to find out. The Icicle comes with a gain knob which is a plus BUT remember with this is a 60 dollar plug n play tool so it doesn't have any other features.<br /><br />*also i didn't have the noise/feedback issue

It is perfectly easy but I have had nothing but problems from mine. There is a constant popping in anything I record.  I am using an AKG C3000B microphone I have had for a long time and it is in perfect condition so the problem is not with my mic.  Anyone else having this problem?

4087;B001EW5YQS;A2V576O8N1GROI;Roejen;1;1;4;1325289600;Decent price for a good product;Works fine for my Podcasting needs. I use it with a sure SM58 microphone. It is made of plastic and does feel cheap but I have had it for a few months and had zero problems with it. For desktop use it should be fine. Works great for my needs. Wouldn't recommend for heavy use on a stage or being tossed around.

4093;B001EW5YQS;A1OY9LNIROSE3E;Rockmesteady;1;1;4;1300579200;great product! unbeatable price!!;3 years ago I bought a Digidesign 002 protools rack and a lot of other equipment to start recording - but I could never get it to work with my OS on either computer.  I was at an impasse for a long time until I saw this product on Blue's website.  I already had a $400 condenser mic in the closet I had never gotten to use and didn't want to spend more money on a quality USB mic.  I couldn't be happy that this product exists - in it's quality or price!  I noticed no noise or coloration of the signal and it worked without a problem.  It does exactly what it's suppose to do -- act like it doesn't exist.  It just serves it purpose to convert the signal well

4095;B001EW5YQS;A1FUDD4U3S5GCA;Suryakant Sansare;1;1;4;1286928000;works but does not have enough gain;using it for recording vocals on home PC using Shure C606 mic. It is a big improvement over the mic to stereo in for sure.. There is no background noise which was very prevailant in the mic in method. The 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the gain. Even with the gain knob turned all the way up i still had to add gain from my software for the sound to be loud enough. But overall a great product.. do not regret buying it and would recommend it as well.
4096;B001EW5YQS;A23NHZBPOOCCPS;Chris Salazar;1;1;5;1280016000;way better than i thought;ive heard mixed reviews of this.. yeah it feels cheap... but so what?! just take care of it like you would anything like that! and it sounds perfect! i use it to record vocals on logic studio (i get others to sing

The only problem is it acts as a sound card and you can't record and listen to yourself at the same time without latency. This is a deal breaker for me. Blue microphones should add a headphone jack onto the interface so you don't have to listen to recordings through your computer and you can hear your recordings in real time.

4138;B001EW5YQS;A3JL82SR4YHE2R;Jonathan Gill;0;0;5;1291507200;AWESOME! BUY FOR SURE!;I bought the ICICLE because I have been doing a lot of hip-hop vocals and I was using a Samson C01U and the thing with that Mic you can get close to studio but with so much work and you can always tell that you messed with it alot.<br /><br />Well I always wanted to buy a expensive Mic but didnt want to spend $200 more on a USB Pre-Amp so I see this on here the other day and went to Guitar Center and after deciding for a while I went with it. I also already had a MXL V-88 which is a pretty high end condenser mic
4139;B001EW5YQS;A2I8IR1MOR982X;Rielle2173;0;0;4;1282608000;Good;I'm glad i came across the blue icicle (on amazon othere prices where 60 or more) before i went on to buy a mic

I use a low budget dynamic mic and the Icicle gives the right boost for PC recording. I keep the gain at 90 to 100 percent and do volume control on the PC.<br />I see some complaints out there about durability. Keep in mind it is a piece of computer hardware like a modem or an external hard drive
4141;B001EW5YQS;A21SXUZ89SOB9F;Rick W;0;0;5;1270771200;Works Great!;I needed the Icicle to provide better audio quality for recordings I was doing on my PC. I wanted to use my high quality XLR mic for this purpose and found that the Icicle provided far better performance than any other USB mic that I currently owned. I didn't have any problem with the trim pod on the Icicle as reported by a previous review so maybe Blue Mic has corrected that issue.<br /><br />I have and do recommend this to anyone that wants to use their current XLR mic on their PC. The product is great and the price is right.

It's so hard being gluten free so this is god sent for how many things you can make with this. I have celiacs and I haven't had any sort of negative reaction to this. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who can't have gluten but still wants things like pancakes and waffles and donuts and other fun things.

4174;B004391DK0;A2XWNL7JV2VE7;J. Lam;0;0;5;1334275200;Perfect!;We use this mix for pancakes and waffles and it's perfect. We have had a terrible time finding a good all purpose flour that is gluten free (the popular brands taste terrible!) so we tend to use this pancake mix as a base for a lot of our recipes--- including breading for baked chicken and other things. It's definitely best as a pancake mix of course

What I do know it that it is a great option for people trying<br />to eat as normal as possible. This GF option has been a great meal saver for my wife who this last year was diagnosed<br />with Celiac and got sick in tired of tasting gross tasting GF options or super simple meat and vegetables options for meals.<br /><br />We have made all types of breakfast items

I have gone to every grocery in AZ and the cheapest place is Amazon! This is a great product and whatever you make using this flour will taste great. My son has Celiac and is allergic to gluten. I have tried every pancake mix and this one is the one I settled for!
4201;B004391DK0;A1XST2J58SFEPS;D. Willard;0;0;5;1322870400;Delicioso;This is a product that is delicious and easy to use. I made the pancakes with buttermilk and the recipe on the box just said milk. The buttermilk helped make the pancakes light and fluffy. I am a little disappointed that the box will only make one recipe that calls for two cups of the mix. I doubled my recipe for the pancakes which made 14<br />4 inch pancakes.  The recipe says it makes 10 pancakes with 1 cup of the mix. Those 10 pancakes must be silver dollar size.  I am looking forward to making the biscuits so I will have to open a second box to have enough mix. The recipe calls for eggs for biscuits and I never used eggs in my regular biscuits.  I am wondering if buttermilk would make these biscuits rise sufficiently? I have family members who can't eat eggs or milk so I must adapt recipes for them. It is a product I would purchase again. However
4202;B004391DK0;A1NNXX4CL5P952;K. Allen;0;0;5;1322784000;Yummy!;These tasted so good! I was surprised because I have heard so many negative things about glutten free bread products. I would eat these by choice

4207;B004391DK0;A926YP1BSD72Y;Shopper11;0;0;5;1321747200;Gluten Free Pancakes!;I use this to quickly make gluten/egg/dairy free pancakes.  I use rice milk and EngerG egg replacer to make pancakes. They taste pretty good and are a good snack to make for later and store in the fridge.  They're especially good w/either apple butter or peanut butter on them besides the usual maple syrup!
4208;B004391DK0;A1V0BAV1DWIKPQ;Dc Dawg Dc Dawg;0;0;4;1321401600;Solid GF Mix;This stuff is pretty solid. Makes a decent enough pancake for being GF and makes a solid biscuit as well. What we have found works best is taking this mix and using it half and half with the Chebe mix. Between the two it makes for a very nice flour mix. The Chebe is good but on its own tends to be a little squishy

I was able to expand my meal plans and make stuff I thought I couldn't have anymore. I made a pizza with my family all in town using this and then a pizza using a different crust and the whole family liked my bisquick crust better. They said it was lighter and had more taste! I really enjoy finding things that make my crazy diet easier to deal with. Thank you thank you thank you.

Hallman Bornoutofthebox;0;0;5;1301702400;Best all purpose gluten free mix i've tried;Hubby had to switch to gluten free because of gluten intolerance so we tried this and made pancakes. They were great and had sort of a corn bread texture to it. FYI: i made cobbler from an regular bisquick recipe (not gluten free) and the measurements do not transfer. The proportions are different with the gluten free mix so make sure you have the right recipe for what you're making.

There are so many things we can make again now that we have Bisquick!  Not to mention that pancakes finally taste like pancakes again!  How nice to be able to have a biscuit with dinner again!  Since GF products are so expensive the best place to get it is at Amazon on the automatic shipment plan.  It's great!

4260;B004391DK0;A3AATF9L2UGZ2K;Melissa Hammons;25;31;2;1286841600;Not impressed.;I was so excited to get this and try it.  Unfortunately I'm not impressed.<br /><br />For starters the value is terrible.  You get 3 cups of mix per box.  That's enough to make 1 batch of pancakes and 1 batch of biscuits (or 3 batches of pancakes whatever).  For almost 4.50 a box that's not worth it to me especially when the end result is mediocre at best.  For the biscuits I made cheddar biscuits and not even the bread loving toddler would eat them.  The pancakes were okay if I used twice as much real maple syrup as I normally do.<br /><br />The pro's?<br />The biscuits did puff up nicely.  That's the only pro I have.
4261;B004391DK0;A3RBMHU2AGJHXN;Mercy Realms Meg;0;0;5;1295654400;Gluten free with good taste;The best gluten free mix I've tried.  Of the recipes on the box I can vouch for the pancakes and the waffles- the biscuits were edible if not enjoyable.  The pancakes and waffles also freeze well.  I also recommend Betty Crocker's Glutenfree Recipe Collection magazine for extra recipes to try with or without this mix. From the magazine I have thus far made the chicken and dumplings (the dumplings disintegrate a bit too easily but are still good) and the fruit swirl coffee cake (I used a full can of pie filling per 8X8- I used apple and lemon pie fillings.  I thought the cake tasted rather like a cobbler or dry danish pastry).  The mix is quick

4301;B004391DK0;A3QWC3FS4JZMJ1;M. Stuart;7;16;1;1309219200;bisquick not aluminum free;A great idea that falls short. Bisquick gluten-free still uses an aluminum-based baking powder that is toxic to humans. Aluminum lodges in our bodies and has been found in quantities unacceptable in autistic individuals. The company refuses to respond to customer inquiries concerning this. I cannot give this to my family until the baking powder formula has been changed.

Ocallaghan Mickiemo;2;2;4;1318723200;Very tasty biscuits!;Ok--I just bought BIsquick GF and the first thing I tried to make were the drop biscuits (recipe listed on the box).  These are not the kind that are rolled out & cut--these are drop biscuits.  The results were very tasty.  The taste of this GF bisquick is very much like the original

4321;B004391DK0;A3N4JE40O6M0JH;Snmalik;4;5;3;1293494400;An easy solution; but...
4322;B004391DK0;A2VBL3JMMB282U;P. Obrien;1;1;4;1350777600;Pretty Good;I can't say that biscuits made from this mix taste as good as the regular wheat.  But that said

I bought this and it's amazing!  Just like the original Bisquick.  Although it is cheaper at Walmart.

From everything I was reading it seemed daunting to mix different flours to make anything.<br /><br />The boxes are SMALL!  While this mix is okay for making pancakes

4334;B004391DK0;A295HJCIBQR2LB;Jeb;1;1;2;1330128000;Bisquick GF Mix;The pricing is quite a bit higher than in the grocery stores.  It is not available in all stores
4335;B004391DK0;AT673J2WAXDDR;Patty H. Patty H.;1;1;5;1329696000;Good gluten free pancakes;These are really good. I like to make them with a little extra milk so that they are thin. I can't even tell the difference between this and regular pancakes. It's worth the price for my family.
4336;B004391DK0;A1XMRQFTR7VNI3;S. Dietrich;1;1;5;1329696000;Best ever!;We've been using Pamela's for making pancakes and waffles
4337;B004391DK0;AKJVBD10PBMG9;Angy;1;1;2;1325635200;Grainy texture;I am giving this two stars as my family didnt mind the taste but the texture was so grainy and the biscuts fell apart easily. I was not a fan of the pancakes at all I believe they really didnt have a good flavor. Will not be wasting my money on such a tiny package either when you can but a bigger package of regular mix for less? Not fair to us with allergies in my opinion!!
4338;B004391DK0;A1FQNNX80WYWKR;K. Muth Kiari;1;1;4;1324252800;Works like Bisquick;I love that it is mainstream and that it works like bisquick. Not all recipes work the same as regular bisquick though.. so I wish they had more recipes available. It does taste more gluten free than some other options out there.
4339;B004391DK0;ADT7O1C83DE53;Mirawhit;1;1;5;1314230400;Great for cobbler!;1 cup gf Bisquick<br />1 cup soy or almond milk<br />3/4 cup sugar<br />cinnamon to taste<br /><br />Pour over your favorite fruit and bake for for a quick delicious cobbler.<br /><br />Gluten-free Bisquick isn't quite as fluffy and crumbly as the original but it is definitely worth it for the GF crowd.

4343;B004391DK0;A2OE9JUIYO5CNA;Maui Boy;1;1;5;1308355200;Gourmet Pancakes;I was able to use this Gluten free product and make it taste better than any restaurant by bringing the buttermilk to room temperature and separating the yokes from the whites and adding additional baking powder and baking soda to the recipe. I love it. Served with pure maple syrup brings it out of this world.
4344;B004391DK0;A2O2784AUYBQOL;P. Harbit;1;1;5;1308268800;Thank Goodness for Bisquick Gluten free!;My 18 year old son cannot tolerate gluten

4350;B004391DK0;A1W88KUEY9PEYA;Lucy Goosey;1;1;5;1306281600;Awesome!;I tried this today with a recipe from my Bisquik cookbook for a chocolate chip cookie recipe. They came out great! My son who has Autism and food sensory issues came back for seconds. My 16 year old daughter stated they tasted like regular cookies. The recipe was easy but took my whole box of mix. They stayed puffy as I like my cookies that way anyway. I experimented with one tray and refrigerated it. It did not matter other than taking another couple minutes of baking. Will definitely buy this mix again.

4360;B004391DK0;A36KSGO33URJOM;Bookworm;1;1;5;1302825600;Love the pancakes;I just recently bought Gluten Free Bisquick for the first time.  It has been wonderful.  I have to admit that I am addicted to their pancakes. They are so light and thick and fluffy (unlike homemade gluten free pancakes).  They are absolutely delicious!
4361;B004391DK0;A21V83IHNU5J4F;Kreativekid;1;1;4;1301356800;great for pancakes!;This product made wonderful pancakes -- I couldn't taste the difference between this Gluten-Free version and the original. I tried using it to make pizza dough to relative success. The texture was a little bit weird but it tasted good!
4362;B004391DK0;A3AARG5QHVY180;Jj;1;1;5;1298160000;Better Than Expected;I was happily surprised with this product. I read other negative reviews and was honestly disappointed in Betty Crocker gf cake mix so I didn't feel the need to try this. I finally bought it at a whim when I saw it at my local market and I am happy I did. I am a baker at heart and love to spoil my family with homemade deserts and pancakes on the weekends. I have adjusted my cooking and baking to primarily gf for the past year now and am happy when I find a gf alternative that cooks & tastes like the real thing. Another plus is that I can buy this at my local market (which does not carry too many specialty foods) and don't have to make the extra trip to the higher end store.<br /><br />I made pancakes today and they were a hit with everyone. Will definitely use it to try other recipes.<br />Only downside is the cost and size of box

I always preferred Bisquick pancakes over other popular brands through the years.  I am happy to say that I can eat my favorite brand of pancakes again without any health repercussions (gluten intolerant).  My next objective is to make the roll recipe on  the box.  I wish all manufacturers would take note of the rising gluten problem in this country!

It's closer to the botique salsas that have recently appeared with the new taco restaurant trend. It's a little smokey. My picky 3-year old will eat a burrito with this on it. My family always had this (mild) on the table in Southern California and now that I've been transplanted in South Florida I am happy to mail-order. You can get the little single-serve pouches directly from the company

My caffeinated coffee is drunk in the morning... only one cup.  So this coffee is pretty good with evening dessert since I won't get wound up.  Flavor is good

It is smooth and satisfying with a full-bodied taste. My wife and I loved the taste and aroma of this ground coffee. For an ideal cup measure one heaping teaspoon full of coffee per cup of hot water. You could change the quantity depending on the strength of the coffee you desire. I generally drink decaffeinated Folgers's brand

4532;B002TMV3E4;ADY836HK6QSYR;Ardnam Ardnam;0;2;4;1286582400;SURPRISE!;I am not a big fan of decaffeinated coffee--I figure what's the point?  Taste is so often compromised.  I have recently found that caffeine bothers me if I drink it after 7pm so it's decaff or nothing at that point.  Riviera Sunrise tastes like regular coffee.  I was so impressed I decided to try it as my morning coffee.  I expected to have a very negative response to not getting the morning caffeine of my usual coffee but that did not happen.  If you must give up caffeine this is a great solution.
4533;B002TMV3E4;A2PK64OVZA1U8Z;Jakester;0;2;5;1285891200;Exceptional coffee!;I've decaffinated a few times and always find myself returning to caffinated coffee for the flavor.

I love it especially for the fact that I don't feel like a live wire all night from having caffine and the flavor is amazing.  Nothing like a good cup of coffee to make you feel warm and fuzzy after a wonderful dinner.<br /><br />I have tried many different coffee's and have to say this one has a wonderful full flavor without the bite of some of the cheaper coffee's.  Melitta is a great brand and well worth the money.  I also use this to make latte's and it's great.  It's a really fine grind and great for which ever way you prefer to have you cuppa java.  You get what you pay for and this is well worth every penny.

After the pet food issues of a few years ago I switched to only organic dog food for her.  Since she is only 10 lbs the price difference isn't too bad.  I am a free feeder which isn't ideal but means my dog basically has access to food any time she wants it.  Because of this she only gets really excited when people food is offered to her.  Well when I open this bag she comes over and eats asap.  Good enough for me!

We tried pretty much every brand that you can buy in pet shops and always had problems with my dog scratching or having her ears get bright red. We found out the problem after one of the cases where she almost went into renal failure after eating her Milkbone treats. We needed something organic without a lot of beef in it.

Sadly Toffifay is impossible to find depending on where you live. I thought ordering 24 packs would be overkill but I'm going through these things like nobody's business. At this rate I'll have to tack on an extra mile onto my daily running regimen
4892;B0018ATXEU;A765FXDHIRE5M;Ozzy0416;0;0;2;1285372800;toffifay;When I got this it was melted through the package and what wasn't completely destroyed was stuck to the inside of the wrappers.  You would think that if you are going to ship chocolate in the summer time you would pack it in something cold.  I wasn't very happy with it.  I love the candy and once you peeled it off the insides of the wrappers it was good.
4893;B0018ATXEU;A66MSWYTXIB5V;Mark W. Peters;0;0;5;1266969600;Glad to have it again.;This candy has gotten harder and harder to find.  It was down to a couple convienence stores in my area that sold it and they stopped.  Now a year later I typed in Toffifay into Bing and up pops Amazon.  Great price for a great candy and I'm well stocked up for the next 6 months.  The hard part is not eating it all the first week!

4910;B0009JMW1C;A3VBBRHETBOP3Y;B-Ricks;1;1;5;1341964800;Great Stuff;I used it for a sinus infection where I lost my voice completely and had a sore throat. I found this product on yelp and went to an herbal Asian store in Chinatown in Phila. I only paid $2.50! the only difference is that I didn't get tea bags they were dissoluble cubes you place in the hot water. It worked great. It took a few hours to work but it worked!. The next day I had my voice back completely and no sore throat. One night I woke up from terrible post nasal drip cough
4911;B0009JMW1C;A15ZLXABTK8F3F;Lk;1;1;5;1332028800;THIS PRODUCT WORKS!;Its allergy season which usually means large amounts of sudafed.  I don't particularly like the side affects of sudafed and have tried tons of different decongestants.  This is the first thing other than sudafed to actually work!  I have not tried it during a sinus migraine yet but for moderate congestion it works wonders.  Smells a bit off but the taste is just fine.  Make sure to seep it for 10-15 mins or it won't work.  Give it about 10-20 mins to kick in.  Seems to last for 3-4 hrs.  No side affects that I can tell.  So glad to be rid of the racing heart side affect and dry mouth/ sore throat that comes with sudafed.  It works great paired with a sinus rinse or netty pot.

I made up a big tea pot (with 2 tea bags) and let it steep for 15 minutes. I had 2 cups and my husband had one. Neither of us noticed any difference with our sinuses. A few days later I decided to try the tea again. I brewed one cup of tea with one tea bag. I let it sit again for several minutes. I guess the first time I tried it I did not make it strong enough. This time I noticed a difference as my sinuses are a little clearer.

The Honey flavor makes them taste very good and they are bigger and thicker than most others I've seen. The saddlebag package is ingenious. why open and expose to the air all 100 when you only have to open half at a time. leave one half (50) completely sealed. One package of 100 thick beef sticks can sustain someone for a very long time. Use for emergency shelters

Within a month of bottling the Pear Chablis our 30 bottles is down to 6 remaining. We have given as gifts and taken to get togethers. My only negative comment is that the starting Specific Gravity is low therefore these are lower alcohol wines. I did add a couple cups of sugar to the fermenter at the beginning...but worried that adding too much sugar would throw off the flavor of the wine. Anyway

It was originally bought for my wife but then she decided to trade off 15 of these for 15 of the White Zin that we were making for a friends wedding. At the wedding it went quick and many people were asking me to make it for them. MY answer was here is where you buy the kit and if you want to buy it and the bottles I would be happy to make it for you. I do not have a license to sell it since this is just a hobby for me.<br /> I did add one can of white grape concentrate after the F-pack was added and that added so much more flavor.<br /> I promise that you can't go wrong with this kit if you like a sweet chardonnay.

But the packaging it arrived in was in Spanish.  Since I don't speak or read Spanish I was a little leery of this item since it was impossible for me to read ingredients and nutritional information panel.<br />The item is labelled as being made in the USA but the website on the label has a .mx extension for being a Mexican company.<br />I don't have anything against our neighbors to the south.  I just expect that when I buy something on Amazon that the labeling will be in English unless otherwise stated.

They did not work for me so I tried Red Rain which did work and was even cheaper.  Red Rain DID work for me so I am done with 5 hour energy and 6 hour power. The ingredients are pretty close to 5 hour energy but someone is lying since it doesn't work.

I do like the taste of the tropical one the best. They all have different taste but if you want something that is grain free and gluten free then this is the right place. I expected the taste to be different and it is. Other reviewers seem to expect them to taste like oreos or chips ahoy. Of course not.<br /><br />When I eat them

Almost double the price...I don't get it.

I love to have these on hand for they come into play so nicely in so many recipes. Always a joy to have a good crunch in some recipes. One of my favorite ways to use this larger can is to wrap a piece of bacon around them and secure with a toothpick. Then I dip them in a Apricot Ginger marinade and put in the oven until the bacon is crisp. My family loves an appetizer dinner once in a while and this is one of their favorites. Be mindful that this is a larger can so have a couple of recipes in mind for them when opening

I'd like to know more about the process for obtaining this water to understand what the natural coconut water means.  The tasty juicy bits of pulp in the product add an extra complexity and make this a very refreshing beverage.  The fresh coconut is jelly like and not so pulpy

Frantz Tough Sell;3;3;5;1334102400;A tea for the ages...;I wasn't much of a tea drinker until I bought a 'Breville' automatic tea maker and a bag of Tummy Tea Fennel for my wife. She started brewing the first pot of this new tea and did it ever smell great- a little like licorice. We both shared that pot and have been hooked ever since. This is one of those teas that makes you just feel warm and fuzzy all over. It is a feeling you do not forget.  If I was stranded on a desert island and could only have one tea this would be it.<br /><br />  For those who enjoy drinking tea I would encourage you to look into the 'Breville' tea maker. Produced by a German firm it is without a doubt an indispensible tool for brewing tea. The price for this mechanical marvel is a little high but believe me it is worth every penny.

We got his diabetes under control with insulin but I began researching diet information to help us.  All of my research led us to try Felidae grain free.  I spent two weeks carefully switching Louis (and the four girls) from dry Iams to Felidae.  I was immediately able to decrease his insulin and by the time I had him totally on Felidae we were able to discontinue insulin totally.  All with our veterinarian's supervision

I ordered the Felidae last time because the Wellness was no longer eligible for free shipping and the Felidae was - which makes the difference between whether it is a better deal to order it or buy it at Petco brick and mortar....None of my cats will eat it. They actually at NOTHING for the past 2 days since the only thing offered them was the Felidae. I broke down today and gave them a back-up can of 9-Lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now. I think Felidae is a high quality food and I only feed the lower quality grain-free food on rare occasion

Meuli;0;0;5;1321488000;excellent product for your cats;I have the coolest different cats ever-with some exotic in them-and this stuff is amazing and really they seem to love it! It does not make the poo smell bad and the digestive system of some of mine-do not tolerate much grain or gluten so that is VERY much a PLUS!  The price on amazon is better for a large-can (amount / per ounce) than i can find at local pet shops or stores.  So when you can get the free shipping it is REALLY awesome to have pet foods at your door-service too! I hope Amazon will just continue to make pet food / supplies to your home affordable and at a top price!  Sometimes though when i go to try to re order cannot find (the same deals)available.  So I just lurk and watch and wait sometimes til it is Offered again to make it affordable. Not sure why -that happens but i know i have to (watch it) to make sure i don't end up with a high shipping fee in my cart-prior to purchase.

I would also recommend purchasing the 11-ounce cannisters because the coffee is freshest when you can pop open a new can and use it up without refrigerating or freezing it.<br /><br />I do not like many dark roasted coffees because I don't like the burnt taste.  Yuban DARK ROAST has NO burnt or bitter taste.  Definitely shun the regular roast for this one.<br /><br />Also

The cost of the seeds themselves are $1.59 as shown on the package. I couldn't find oat grass seeds at Lowes or my local independent garden center. I'm hoping to find somewhere local to buy them so I can buy more seeds in the future without having to pay a premium and wait for them to ship.

5296;B002TMTP12;A1R3VFN96PO1DX;Christopher Zahka;11;11;4;1305676800;3000 != 850;The fact that the title of this product includes the number 3000 is misleading.  I'm not even sure what that number refers to.  I can tell you that it does not refer to the quantity of gumballs in the package (which is 850).  It's true that the product details stated the actual quantity of 850

Most peach flavored teas taste like sugar and artificial flavors but not this drink.  It is wonderfully watery to quench any thirst.  I only wish that Amazon would always sell it because we would buy it on a regular basis.
5299;B0017T1LI8;AAJZFZNWSDXDH;Avidinternet;0;5;1;1294963200;Just a word of warning for those that love this tea;Look at the ingredients...it is made with Black Tea...Google Black tea and Fluoride and you will see that black tea is LOADED with fluoride because it is made with the oldest part of the tea plant it contains the highest level of fluoride of any tea. Fluoride is not healthy for anyone. If you want a healthy natural tea

5308;B004XMIRU6;A1NKZ7A7T47413;Amazon Fan;1;1;5;1336780800;Wow that Expensive for coffee;This is by far the best Kona Coffee I've had. I use to purchase Trader Joes Kona Coffee but for the last several months they haven't had any and I've been unable to locate Kona any where so I thought I'd try Amazon. I saw this and although the price is staggering

They have a different technique the way it is grown then most coffees. I thought I would check to see if it was on Amazon. This is the best tasting coffee I ever tasted.  Well worth the money.
5311;B004XMIRU6;A2M1ZGLFW29ED3;John J Adams;0;0;5;1317254400;Medium Roast Kona Coffee;This coffee has a smoother and milder taste than a dark roasted coffee.  I like to have this coffee and a dark roasted on alternate mornings.  The daily contrast in taste keeps me appreciating the delicious coffee favors of each type.

Every Vet will tell you  the same thing and you will never see any quality treats or food that has sugar or corn syrup on the ingredient list. If you do see it on the list
5336;B0058HWQO8;AJYCQWIPOM53D;Wilda Walker Tazwalker;0;0;1;1338854400;Too much for shipping;This is my 2nd review for this product.  The first one was supposed to be 75 words.  That would be too long for this item.  The product itself is good but the price for shipping for such a small item was ridiculous.  The package was small and light weight but I was charged $6.78 for shipping of a $4.99 item.  I have bought many items from amazon.com and it seems here lately that the shipping has gotten totally out of hand. I bought several items and the shipping was all together.  Therefore I did not know how much was charged for each item. I will not buy from this vendor again since they are making money on the shipping.  Enough said.

So far I have only tried (and intend to try) the Key Lime Pie and the Mint Chocolate Chip but they are both amazing.  They key lime pie is incredibly tart and delicious but unfortunately the flavor only lasts about 10 seconds.  The Mint Chocolate Chip is also incredible and the flavor seems to last much longer (or at least

I'm so disgusted and can't believe I waited over a week for this to arrive.  What a waste of my time.  The worst part is I ordered the fruit flat as well and also a broken jar and rotten mold everywhere.  I don't get how this happens the  shipping box isn't dented or damaged neither is the flat box.

5450;B00622CYVI;A1N8QD8YDUF5YK;Concerned Mom;2;2;2;1346025600;RECENT TALK WITH CUSTOMER RELATIONS RE BPA LINER;Just off the phone with them (Aug/12) and they said that yes they stopped putting BPA in the liners in Oct/11. Of course there is old stock on the shelves so I asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the old (with BPA) or the new (without BPA) and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid. If it is all white then it is BPA free - if it is metallic or gold then it's the old lids which did contain a BPA layer. Thought this might help some of you out there!

My son usually like all the flavors.  I ordered this and the pears were sour/spoiled.  The other flavors my son refused to eat. I am sure there was something wrong with it.  So I am not sure what happened but I will NOT be buying these online anymore.

Now if I were to review his vegetables I might have to deduct a star for him but that's just because he doesn't seem to care for peas much.

I did not give it 5 stars because I thought the consistency of the pears was a bit thin and runny for stage 2.  That is easily solved if you mix the fruit with some cereal.

He has never had a reaction of any kind to any baby food I have given him. This is the first time I have tried this particular variety pack. I fed him the Peach Oatmeal Banana and Apples and Apricots for breakfast this morning. Shortly after I noticed he was scratching. I looked and he had a rash. I remembered reading a baby food review where someone mentioned an allergy so I checked and yes it is this variety pack. I don't know what is in it that would cause this type of reaction. Unfortunately I fed him two different jars so I don't know which one caused it but I don't want to take a chance of him having another one so out they go. Just thought I would let others know.

Very fresh!;Coriander is a spice many people pass up or simply overlook and very rarely use except when they might make a corned beef brisket every so often. Sometimes you will find a bit of it in popular seasoning blends as well but it's usually a task to find just a small bottle of reasonably priced coriander in grocery stores which deters folks even more from experimenting with this terrifically tasty and fragrant spice. The Frontier coriander powder is wonderfully citrusy and robust

The only reason that I won't purchase it again is:  the amount in the package is very little and for as much as I steam rice (for not only my kids and me but our French bulldogs) it is just Not enough for the price you have to pay.  Way too expensive.  So

I've lived in Hawaii most<br />of my life and have shopped mostly in the local health food stores-so i have had<br />many many different batches of Basmati rice.  What Amazon has sent me is NOT<br />edible in my opinion.  It is not long grained as Basmati should be and does not<br />cook as it should - it fully cooks too soon and does not need the full amount of<br />water that Basmati usually does.<br />I am tempted to contact the FDA to see what it really is!<br /><br />My apologies to the reviewer from Florida - i should have listened to you and<br />passed on all this frustration - Amazon does not allow returns on groceries.<br />Needless to say - i am now stuck with several pounds of inedible rice.

Some of the fondant work on this seller's other cakes is shabby the piping is horrible...worse than a cake you would buy at the grocery store. The flowers look like red and green blobs. How can you possibly think you should sell these to people?

Once I received it and tasted it I was not so happy. First off tasted like the smell of dirty water. Best way I can describe it lol This has cane juice yet tastes like it doesn't have anything. Added calories for what no flavor? No Thanks. So yeah all in all pretty flavorless (beside the dirty water smell taste). Was a huge disappointment. Worse yet I bought 2-12 pk cases. Now I have to doctor the rest up. Maybe just buy some lemons and make them into a green tea lemonade? Oh well

The puree seems to be easier to consume than prune juice and we used to give it to our baby with yogurt. It soon became his favorite food and eased his symptoms.  I highly recommend this product to parents who are having a hard time with their babies' constipation.

I was a little weary about ordering them because of the last two reviews. But I received a perfectly packaged item. They were not melted and didn't have a powdery texture to any of the gummi bears. They are my husband's favorite! We have been enjoying them since we received them and I'll be ordering more for events that are coming up.

5551;B004G94ZPW;AGXZACYDNMYTH;Krisy;0;0;5;1334102400;Great deal and everyone loved them!;I bought these to add to my Easter favors. I love the colors for that reason - basic and pastel - all of which are different flavors.  I didn't eat any myself but my friends who received the favors LOVED them!  I have a Prime Account so the gummies shipped very quickly so there was no melting going on (other reviews mentioned this).  Can't complain about the price for a 5 pound bag. It was a great deal and if I needed buy gummies in bulk again I would definitely buy these mini bears.
5552;B004G94ZPW;AYMHIMW47637M;Ktcupcake;0;0;5;1333411200;Best gummy bears ever;My boyfriend tried these gummy bears at our favorite frozen yogurt place and said they were the best gummy bears ever. I sued them to tell me what kind they were and found them on amazon. Then bought a 5 lb. bag of them for him haha. He wanted to go get frozen yogurt every other day just for the gummy bears. Anyway

Due to the heat of the delivery truck it all melted into gel. Of course it is not refundable so now all i have is a bag a liquid-multicolored goo. thanks for making me throw away 15 dollars. Good game amazon. So think about if its summer or kinda warm
5557;B000Y4145M;A19XBW5WUDH1Z;David Nox;1;1;4;1203033600;Dogs loved them;I have 3 chihuahuas and I thought these would be better for them since they are smaller than a full ear. They still were too much for the little guys. I would say a dog 20-30+ pounds should be able to handle them better than my 8lb guys.<br />They had a strange smell and felt slightly oily to the touch. I don't know if that was something added to them to preserve them or it was natural.<br />My chihuahuas are fussy and they liked them I was just worried about blockages since they seemed to swallow large chunks of them. They didn't have any problems and my 4lb was able to handle them I just wouldn't buy them again since my guys are too small. The bags were a good size for the price. I bought three and should have bought one bag.<br />I rated them 4 stars since they were of good quality just better for larger dogs in my opinion.

On am impulse we purchased them and made them that night. AMAZINGLY good. Made with a cube of butter so be warned! YUMMMY! We went back and bought all the packages on the shelf and had the owners reorder many times for us. We have since moved to another state and have been trying to hunt these down. What a pleasure to find them on our old haunt Amazon. Order

By evening I was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.<br /><br />Side effects can include:<br />*diarrhea<br />*intestinal cramps or gripping pains<br />*rash<br />*severe weight loss<br /><br />Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease

Cant remember exact name but think it is something like MB - is a french company and I got it in canada and by mail order after that.  It is much better to my taste.  Never dreamed there would be this much variance among fennel seeds as only ingredient.

I think because it is easy<br />to eat instead of a big chunk.  This looks like little<br />square slices of beef.  It smells good too.  Whenever<br />I open a can of this

Davis The Happy Hermit;6;7;5;1198108800;The taste is as good as the aroma;I got a case of Yuban cans from Amazon for an amazing price and now that I've been reintroduced to Yuban I'm sticking with it.  It's Colombian which is the coffee I prefer anyway but Yuban  must have a special formula for roasting and grinding that results in such excellent coffee.  Cans have the foil seals that you can peel off so you don't need to use a can opener and of course plastic lids to reseal.  Sniffing this coffee as I scoop it into my coffee maker is half the delight!!  Just so excellent and suits my tastes perfectly.  Buying the case is very convenient too!!!!

We have tried ever coffee on the shelves at all the supermarkets far and wide. We had been drinking Yuban for at least 10 years in Las Vegas. We called the District Manager for Kraft and found out that East Coast people don't like it or were not accustomed to it. West of the Mississippi is where you'll find it. So we had to order by the case load to satisfy our drinking pleasure. We got the best deal from<br />Amazon

I was delighted to discover that I could order it at Amazon.com by the case and always keep it in our pantry.  The only thing that could be any better would be that I could get Yuban beans so I could grind it myself as I make a pot of coffee.

It comes in one pound vacuum sealed packs so it stays super fresh and it just fills my canister with one bag.  I like not having to get rid of all those plastic cans and I have it automatically sent to the door so I don't have to deal with those last minute trips to the store and find they are out.

Only 2 weight watcher point and 90 calories. When I was in Girl Scouts in the 60's there was a cookie like this Savannah it was an oatmeal crunchy sandwich cookie filled with peanut butter icing. The first bite I took I was back there. It was so good. I love that they are wrapped one to a pack and not double. I eat one everyday. They range from $2.98 to $3.89 a box in my area so the subscribe and save is the way to go. I tried the dark chocolate and they are also good but the memories the peanut butter ones bring with the flavor are my favorites.<br /><br />If you remember those cookies you will love these.

5701;B001FWXLX0;A1LNMRBMELKFVU;Black Swan;0;0;5;1350518400;Bye-Bye Lucini;My husband & I have always bought Lucini vinegar's but in todays economy we try to look for a substitution since Lucini is expensive. I hit the jackpot right off with Cherry Republic's Sweet Cherry Balsamic. My husband & I use the cherry vinegar straight up on our salad as dressing or on a plate of fresh sliced tomatoes so it can draw out the true flavor. This vinegar is even sweet enough to sprinkle on a bowl of fresh sliced fruit for an extra kick but tart enough to use as basting on your fried chicken or fish. You cant go wrong with this vinegar for the price.....so we say bye-bye Lucini's Cherry Balsamic

I decided to try Spicy World Vanilla Beans rather than the much more expensive vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma.  Two vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma in a pint of vodka resulted in a very dark richly aromatic vanilla after only two months.  I used three Spicy World vanilla beans in a pint of vodka and after two months I had a liquid that looked like weak tea and had the aroma of alcohol.  I added three more beans and waited.  The results were disappointing

They were very moist and I was very pleased at the quality of the beans. I immediately used 18 of the 50+ to make homemade vanilla extract. The beans did not come with storage instructions so I googled it and read that I needed to store them in an airtight container. I've used them a few times over the past month for cooking but I still had over half the package left. Well

From the moment you open the box you can smell them and they are still sealed in their bag.  They are very pliable unlike most of the big store ones and the seeds are very moist and easy to remove.  I needed to make a new batch of vanilla sugar and this was the first time I had to put some crackers in with it as the sugar was clumping within a week.  Should make an interesting cracker too.<br />John

They smell like all of the other vanilla beans that I've bought.

She also suffers from skin allergies and even though she is on meds I think this food has helped a bit with her dry skin. I only have one issue her breath smells really fishy after she eats but thats not even a big deal anymore. Also the price is cheaper than other online stores like petco and petsmart plus free delivery. All in all If Mona's happy so am I.

5844;B001EQ5EJQ;A253VUYT5I3KLH;Monica Monica;7;7;4;1312848000;Savory and earthy flavor;Flavor 5 STARS:  First time I used the oil I poured some in a saute pan to scramble some eggs. It ended up being an earthy mushroom like flavor. I loved it.  I pour it on my dogs food occasionally and they love it.  I wanted to buy this originally because I watched the Dr. OZ tv show and he recommended ingesting a little every day for its anti-inflammatory properties.  I gave some oil to my Aunt who has an auto-immune disease and she likes the oil as well. I would definitely buy this product again.<br /><br />Ding for metal alloy container: It is cheap metal and though it was packaged well by Amazon.com the containers probably got dented in Amazon's warehouse because it didn't seem like the packaging should have caused the dents.  The way it was packaged if there was any damage it would probably only be dents to the containers so I would say expect dents with any shipment of oils if this company uses the same cheaper kind of metal alloy for their containers.  Dents do not make the product taste worse so I do not worry about the taste.  I will return it if the containers leak but that would not stop me from ordering again.  However

I also roasted some yukon gold potatoes and english squash with the oil and it turned out wonderful--the walnut oil gives it a great flavor.  I will be giving one can to my parents.

5869;B001EQ5EJQ;A2DJCXHZSGVAT6;Indyhannah;0;0;5;1349481600;Great product at the right price;One of my favorite salad recipes I make often calls for walnut oil.  I bought a small bottle from a local major grocery store and it was over $10 for about 6 ounces.  Steep!  I love walnuts so naturally I loved this oil from my very first taste.  But the price was not right so I searched on the Internet and found this.  I was a little reluctant to buy 3 cans as I thought they go rancid before I can finish but I am now on my last can.  I use it in place of EVOO to make other vinaigrettes too.  Or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and B&S (or seasons salt like Krazy Salt) over spring mix

I put two crackers into a zip lock baggie.  Break them into bite sized pieces and this is my treat throughout the day and into the evening and they are very filling.

It was their first beef and their first spinach.  I had already given them chicken and they really like it so they are not vegetarians yet anyway.  Mostly I wanted this product for the spinach and the higher iron content.  Somehow they made this particular flavor brand tasty for babies.<br /><br />I like getting these by the case rather than buying them a jar at a time at the store since 2 babies eat so much.  It's good to keep several flavor brands around too I think

The aroma is pungent with the savory smell of coffee and the sweetness of chocolate.  The chocolate flavor is rich yet delicate so it doesn't overwhelm.  I purchased four bags of the ground coffee first for my daughter.  She insisted I taste it even tho I don't like flavored coffee or 'dark' chocolate. I enjoyed it so much I took back a bag and purchased 4 bags of the whole beans to grind when needed for that added freshness.  While I will not drink flavored coffee all the time

Although grown from a tiny little seed that the sun and rain helps in growth it is our heavenly father our creator God who truly makes them grow and should be appreciated for his gift of life to us all and for our home the planet we call earth .<br />I used to be a true vegetarian then I went to only eating Poultry and some fish and eggs through out the years.Now I will eat vegetarian soup made with some beef stock but I don't care for the meat itself and no pork.<br />I am still Organic Alternative and Green but I am slowly trying to go back to being that true vegetarian that I used to be however going raw will take a some time because I have a little hard time chewing with my teeth like my friend but after I get my dentures I will be able to adjust into it .Right now I am canning for winter storage.I have dehydrated my whole garden into green super power food that I added to my barley greens. note if you choose to cook get the Fagor Pressure cooker caner That I got it helps make the meals go quicker and is a lot healthier than baking and Broiling or grilling and never fry food.<br />Well I will let you know how the canning turn out and one day I'd like to make home made all fruit yes that's right not jelly or jam.<br />Hi Again so far so good I have canned 4 pint jars of my home made spaghetti sauce with 4 of Chili and 4 vegetarian soups with 2 red cabbages and they sealed and are ready for winter when things get rough as around here it is hard to get organics so when I do I get all that I can like I just got up at the farmers market this late fall and then I either freeze them or can them and even dehydrate them.<br />So I will keep you up to date but I need to try and get some organic fruits and that is hard to get again around here.<br />well catch ya later as I never say goodbye!Just get this wonderful organic fruit nut and seed mix it has no preservatives and is delicious and affordable and if I can get it you can too. Just remember to soak the nuts and seeds because nature puts some  protective coating on it and they need to break down this to be edible and fit for human consumption.

I tried Ghiraradelli's premium cocoa mix and found it much too sweet that it was almost unpalatable. And not a very chocolatey taste either. The directions given for one serving are 4 Tbsp of the powder to 8 oz of milk.  Did they meant 4 tsp?  Using their directions would yield a total of 8 cups of hot cocoa -- not very economical for a product with so much sugar.  I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed.

Really????;Talk about horrible . . .<br />I was craving carrot juice and the store was out of the brand I normally like which has what I like for ingredients: Carrot Juice.<br /><br />I did see before buying that it said it had Organic Lemon Juice in it when I looked at the ingredients but I figured that the makers would only add it if it didn't change the taste that much.  Well all I have to say is I taste no semblance of carrots at all.  It tasted more like drinking a bad V-8 or something.  Then after sipping a couple of ounces I now have an acid reflux feeling in my throat and chest.  I drink water with lemon pretty often and never have that happen.  So now I'm wondering exactly how much lemon juice is in here.<br /><br />If you want carrot juice this is NOT for you.  I don't even think they should call it that . . .<br /><br />I don't normally do it

6174;B0041HNGGS;A3K2WNED2FTSC7;Cmp;2;2;5;1339718400;Great intro to spherification;It's true you also need a decent scale (I used <a href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OKR89G>Jennings CJ300 300g X 0.1g Scale</a>).  I tried the Caviar Cointreau recipe [...] and everything worked perfectly on the first try (it's fast too - under 20 minutes & I'm sure faster once you get the hang of it).  It's fun & very easy to make (a juice recipe would be a really fun way to do an edible chemistry experiment with kids).  The kit comes with large enough samples that it looks like it'll be good for 40+ uses.
6175;B0041HNGGS;A3A1X149QRBTNT;So Cal Family;14;28;2;1317168000;As described but difficult to use;I bought the kit to dabble in spherification. The item is as-described and arrived on time. My complaint is that the instructions measure the required chemicals in fractions of grams. My kitchen scale measures as low as 1 gram but does not do fractions of grams. I cannot find a kitchen scale that measures fractions of grams. Therefore I find the kit difficult to use. I would not recommend the kit because it requires the purchase of specialized scale that can measure tenths of grams.

These chips are pretty healthy as far as chips go made from brown rice and pop when chewed on. I bought them @Top Food's here in WASHINGTON State Costco has the larger 16oz BAG in the sweet chile flavor only. Price was $2.99 at Top Foods for 5.5oz size $2.88 on Amazon for same size.<br />Costco was $4.99 for the 16oz size...

6191;B000UOFW9K;A2H1POL8TUN17J;Karen D. Merrill;3;4;1;1219622400;great chips but terrible shipping;The chips are awesome.  I first bought them at Costco and now I cannot get them there any more.  The bags at Costco were about 3 times larger than the one I recieved from Amazon.  The arrived mostly in tiny crumbles of chips and the bags were about 1/3 full.  I won't waste my money buying them from Amazon again as the shipping is just not up to par.  If you can find the chips retail I would advise buying them that way.  Their website says that super target and Costco carries them but have not been able to find them there recently.

I never can find it is the stores so I always buy it here and it is so much cheaper then a store. I pour it in a pie pan roll the chicken in it then bake. After I roll all the chicken I put the remaining glaze in a Zip Lock gallon bag and place in the freezer till the next time. Sometimes I mix the glaze with plain Chicken Shake n Bake for a crunchy BBQ coating.

You have to buy in bulk but (going by the ones that I received) they don't expire for over a year so as long as you store it correctly you should be able to buy in bulk even if it's a small household like mine.

The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying

I've tried plain chamomile and it didn't make the cut. Nothing beats a cup or two of Sleepy Time before bed as it calms the nerves and settles the tummy.  What a perfect way to drift off into slumber !

This CS Sleepytime Tea is my absolute FAVORITE evening tea ritual!  I think it is the wonderful flavor of camomile plus the spearmint that adds that extra something refreshing...ahhhh...(sigh)...big yawn...I'm toddling off to sleep now........  P.S.  I also love a cup anytime I'm feeling somewhat stressed and especially whenever I need to wind down like after a long time on the computer or after stressful shopping trips.  Take a cup and you'll really be in a mellow place.

This is spoken from the perspective of a diabetic who hasn't had regular taffy for years but I think this would hold its own next to regular taffy pretty easily.<br />Its sweetened with sucralose
6390;B00811X8NQ;A356MAIAG72C1P;Amanda;0;0;5;1350691200;low calorie and my dogs love!;I bought this along with the easy freeze ice cube trays for my two dogs. My vet put my lab on a diet so I have been looking for low calories treats to feed him for his evening snack. Each packet is only 30 calories and will fill one easy freeze ice cube tray (six large ice cubes for the extra large size). One packet will also fill my labs kongxl and my terriers Kong medium. They love it and make sure they lick their Kong's clean without getting bored with it. Overall a great snack!

It's great stuff - the gravy is so very thick and the food looks like bits of steak slicked off for your friend.  My cat licks the bowl clean every time and wants more.  They should send me discounts for as much of this stuff I buy.  I buy it by the case if that gives you some idea!

I didn't really plan on eating the whole bag since they are mostly gonna be used as reinforcement to get my kids potty trained.  My two year old girl doesn't really care so much but they work wonders for my four year old with autism.  I give her one after she potties and washes her hands and she couldn't be happier.  I do find myself reaching in and getting handfuls at times but I try not to go overboard.

6452;B000FNEX50;A1G2KWKK44V3CV;Ryan J. Nardiello;7;7;5;1158796800;From a person with a very limited diet;I agree with everything that the previous reviewer wrote in their review.  I gave the cookies a rating of 5 stars though because i havent eaten a cookie in about 4 years without getting sick.  This is because I have severe allergies to wheat and soy.  Pretty much every cookie you will find in a normal grocery store will have one if not both of these ingrediants.  So when I found Nana's cookies I was as happy as can be.  Yes the texture is different than a wheat cookie but it's better than going without cookies.  It also doesnt hurt that these cookies are delicious.  If you are like me and have a very limited diet these cookies are  a very welcome addition to that diet.

I have been gluten-free for five years and have tried near everything.  Nana's has become part of my weekly grocery list.  They are easy to take on the go.  I think these would be great for parents with allergic children because they are packaged for on the go.  It can be frustrating to be out and you suddenly get hungry and there is nothing gluten-free to be found.

She says it has a nice strong coffee flavor but smooth not bitter.  I don't drink coffee but I took some to work for the drip machine there and several of the coffee drinkers love it.
6532;B00008O36H;A3MX63FHISNPQ3;David Morris;0;0;4;1289433600;Great for our dogs!;Our two Golden Retrievers have been on Beneful Weight Control now for at least 3 years. We didn't see any out of the ordinary pooping problems that others mention.  They love it and both have lost considerable weight -- both were considered obese
6533;B00008O36H;A2M9PWAYQIYD0B;Ross;0;0;1;1256256000;unless you want to pick dog poop off the floor...I don't recommend;We have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the Beneful Healthy Weight we've noticed very unpleasant results. They whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we don't get them outside in time.  Our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to 6 or 7 times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have. My theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body. Which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving.  Poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative. I will most likely be going back to Purina One.
6534;B00008O36H;A2NY4CIN9LXH9Q;Camille Long;0;0;5;1246320000;Great Dog Food!;I put all my dogs on this food about a month and a half ago. I began to notice my older/overweight dog become more playful and energetic. He has already lost some weight. Also all of the others have more solid stools and they actually enjoy eating this. I would recommend this to everyone.

6554;B003DKY5R8;A2LVZHNKMQM9UV;Mopar Seven Prov 29:18;0;1;3;1323043200;Might as well chew it....;This tea is so strong you might as well not waste time brewing and just chew the leaves right out of the container. It's strong not in a normal strong tea way. Instead it's bitter. If you use a Keurig model that has cup size settings a recommendation is to go with the largest setting for the largest cup you can fit under the Keurig and work backward from there until you get to the taste you prefer. Also note that while it's in smaller print

He is somewhat of a picky eater when it comes to dog treats but he loves these. They smell nice and minty and take a little while for him to eat so it gives him something to work at. They are made with good ingredients. No meat byproducts or corn! AND they are made in the USA which is definite plus. I will continue to get these for my pup.

I've tried all of the gels and chews that are out there and these are my favorite.  I don't like gels as that squirt of mush activates my gag reflex.  Plus you always need water with them.  I've tried all of the other brands of energy chews (I think)

Park;0;0;5;1316476800;Great for Marathon Training;I'm training for my first marathon in November 2011 and these chews have kept me going during my long 18 to 20 mile training runs.  I dissolve them in water rather than carry them as chews and sip steadily after mile 8.  They taste like concentrated hawaiian punch and do not upset my stomach whatsoever.  I also eat them prior to a workout if I am feeling low energy and will even snack on them in lieu of candy.  Seriously
6606;B002BRC562;ARZIAGNKTDYGG;Brad;0;0;5;1314662400;Best tasting energy boost;Stingers are better tasting and more convenient than gels and work just as well to provide energy when exercising over long periods of time.

Ramsey;0;0;5;1312848000;Great tasting with help keeping energy up.;I was excited to try these little honey chews to help with my energy levels during exercising and running.  I am 60 years old and about 50 pounds overweight.  I find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising.  First of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary.  I was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup.  I guess with the package calling it honey stinger I was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers.  Still

A can of soda has 150 for 12 ounces so I am not sure what the trade off is unles you want 100% of your vitamin C!

Great orange taste plus the benefit of juice.  And no corn syrup sweetner for those worried about its use.

6862;B001LG945O;AO4A961ZKHJPL;Enrique Torres Rico;0;1;3;1248739200;Nothing special;As the title of my review indicates this product is nothing special in terms of taste. Granted it is missing some of the soda pop bad guys (high fructose syrup and coloring)but the taste is mediocre. This is not something you are going to rave about because of the taste. If you are a health food junkie you might overlook the bland middle of the road taste. Contrary to some reviews I did not find the drink exceptionally sweet but than again everyone has different taste buds. I am not a soda pop drinker so that might have some influence on my less than enthusiastic endorsement. I was switched off. Will this make you give up your favorite soda pop? Probably not. I like the idea of homemade soda water infused juice for that perky fizzing drink better than Switch. Not such a great product in my opinion.

It is a bit high in sugar but at least it is natural fructose sugar from the fruits (again

The difference is that this one leans more on the fruit side rather than the soda or sugar side.  I liked that about it.  While it was sweet it wasn't syrupy sweet to the point that it was cloying and it did not have a strong after taste.  Also it had a much more juicy aspect to it.  Its kind of hard to describe but the best comparison I can make is it's like one of those fruity V8 juices only carbonated.  Maybe that's not right either but I'd recommend trying this at least once.  It just may be a taste you'll find you'll like again.

This is actually a beverage that I could drink all the time and not get tired of.<br /><br />The BEST thing about Switch is that it is HEALTHY for you and it doesn't have any added sugars and it has a lot of Vitamin C. Switch is a all natural beverage which is great. You can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda.<br /><br />If you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then I highly recommend Switch. If you like orange juice then I think you'll really enjoy this. The cans are a little on the smaller side though.

I am a lover of both orange juice and sunkist type drinks so I was very eager to try this drink.  It is the perfect combination of sweet and fruity!!!  The tangerine I believe helps give the extra lift of the sweet taste.  If you're trying to cut back on pop

It's sort of orange flavored. It has a sharpness but there's nothing about it that excites me. It's a good old fashioned carbonated beverage and if it's inexpensive buy it. If it's significantly more expensive than most drinks

It starts with a nice citrus zing but then finishes with a little sweet.  I was hoping for the zing to continue or get more full but it died.<br /><br />The overall taste is not as sweet as an orange soda and not as citrus as an Izze or similar citrus beverage.<br /><br />Overall

The taste is okay but takes a bit getting used to the tangerine in orange soda.  There was not as much carbonation which is fantastic as far as I'm concered and it wasn't exceedingly sweet.  I would most certainly consider getting this again as I don't think it's all that bad.  It's nice to have a bit of change from the usual orange soda flavor.

The only drawbacks I have found is that you really have to fill the filter all the way up to get good flavor. It leaks a little bit so the outside of the cup is a bit wet after using. Lastly

Its so tedious to refill every time you want a cup of coffee. Especially at 4am before work! These cups are so easy to use and perfect for mornings when you just want a quick cup of coffee. The lids are a little tough to get on sometimes and they get stuck in the top of the machines occasionally

7024;B004K30HO2;AHEZGOJFMLDZL;Bob Bakerman;0;0;5;1316217600;Excellent product;I have tried another brand of one cup coffee making.  These made the job easy and no mess.  The other method had a plastic holder and lid and a paper basket.  You disposed of the inserted paper basket only.  The plastic would be very warm to the touch at the very least.  Then you had to rinse the plastic holder and top for any grinds that might have escaped.

The solutions are to get multiple baskets or the disposable type. The filtering is a little better and the coffee has fewer solids. It is easy to use and does what it says.

7046;B004K30HO2;A1TSBETBCSKVAA;Frank F;0;0;3;1310169600;Not bad but alittle pricey;It is difficult to judge the amount and grind of coffee to put in the K-cups. If it is too fine a grind or is too packed full it only give you a half of a cup.

It clogged the system causing the water to back up producing a half cup of coffee or water spilling outside the top of the unit.

You will see there is already a filter inside.<br />Fill with your own coffee.<br />Place a small square of aluminum foil on top and be sure to make it tight and sealed around the top edges of the cup.<br /><br />Now reuse your cup a few times or many

You can hear the screams about that by reading the reviews for the 'My Cup'. The gasket moves too much and as a result is does not seal correctly.

7073;B004K30HO2;A13WQVHNRQ26MX;Fabu Nobo Fabu Nobo;10;10;5;1327104000;How to stop the leaking!;After a lot of trial and error (with just water!) I figured out how to make these handy self-fill coffee pods NOT leak all over the place. The secret is to shove the filter all the way into the pod and NOT snap the lid over the edge of the filter. Make sure the filter is ALL INSIDE. It's rigid enough and stays upright and fine when you brew. You really need to create a seal with the lid. Leaving the filter hanging out breaks the seal and allows liquid to seep out.

7100;B004K30HO2;A2KJNF9DL1UXVE;Dareader;1;1;4;1330041600;DisposaCups;I recently received a Kuerig Coffee Maker  and realized that the coffee cups would be a costly add on to the product. DisposaCups came to the resue. These durable cups can be filled with your own coffee rather than the expensive Kuerig cups. My only issue with these cups is that when I fill them to save for later use
7101;B004K30HO2;A1V53K3EL57R59;Papa1935;1;1;1;1329004800;poor design;The lids keep popping off when the cup fills up with water
7102;B004K30HO2;A1D90B1WXLVFT8;Betty Lou Webb Blwebb;1;1;1;1328659200;disposable k cups;We put together the cups.  Everything went well with t he coffee into the cups along with a filter.<br />When putting the kcup into the coffee machine it would only drip.  I checked everything and it was put together correctly. I took the made up cups to my son's coffee maker keurig brand also
7103;B004K30HO2;A2NPO27XPDDIVB;Rick Smith;1;1;1;1328659200;Did not work well - clogged my machine;I was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original K-Cups
7104;B004K30HO2;ACDJDU3VK01QI;Sharon I. Clark Nana;1;1;5;1328400000;Great product;The pods worked as described.  I did not have overflows. I found the best way to secure the top is to press the raised area in the center of the top. Wish they were sold in larger quantities
7105;B004K30HO2;A1A83U2XUOBWD9;Janet;1;1;1;1328054400;Good try ...but;I was really hoping that your product would solve my discontent with the Keurig coffe maker that I received for Xmas.  I am a coffee and chicory drinker so of course I wanted to have the same great coffee thru the Keurig machine.  The mesh filter that I bought first left a slimed residue in the brew....so I believed that the paper filter you created would do the job....well it does it's work properly but it is a little large for the Keurig device....so water and grinds sort of go everywhere.......I dont think your product isnt good ...the whole Keurig experience is a great disappointment!
7106;B004K30HO2;A2PLYT4QRPZTF1;Gracie Gracie;1;1;4;1326672000;Very helpful. I can use my own coffee;I had been looking for something to use with my own coffee. I know the Keurig has its own My K-cup but I wasn't satisfied with the results. There were also suggestions on making personal k-cups by saving the used k-cups and rinsing them out and refilling them with coffee and then covering them with foil or plastic wrap. What a pain that was.<br /><br />After looking at several different disposable k-cups for the keurig I came across this one and felt it did what I wanted. Much less mess involved and works great.
7107;B004K30HO2;A2GXQISRQZKR8H;Jane Weier;1;1;4;1324512000;Disposable is great!;These DisposaKups work great.  I simply fill up a dozen or more with my favorite flavored coffee

7109;B004K30HO2;AOBSK6CTJXJSW;Courtney Kearns Potter_Fan;1;1;5;1321488000;Real money saver!;Awesome idea!  I couldn't find my husband's favorite coffee in the k-cups
7110;B004K30HO2;AFGT1SIM5B2XT;Friesenburgers;1;1;5;1321315200;Great Product;This product is the way to go for making your own favorite blend of coffee and loose leaf tea. I use them for tea and found that I can reuse them for two or three cups.
7111;B004K30HO2;ACFXG17EG3LE3;Andrew Heller;1;1;4;1319068800;Good product - expensive shipping;I purchased this product to be able to use my own coffee and tea in the Keurig. The product does what it says. The only drawback that I can tell exists is the expensive shipping. I'd also like to have some suggested measurements for coffee and tea to fill the cup. Perhaps a section on their website where people can just start recording their experiences with different amounts of product... Just my 2 cents.
7112;B004K30HO2;AV0Y59CB5UCKI;Stacey Weeaks;1;1;4;1318636800;Glad I got 3 boxes;I really like the idea of the K cup coffee maker. You make it the strength that you want and no wasting a half a pot of coffee. I DID NOT like the horrible price for the pre-made K cups. This is a great compromise. The only thing that could be a bit of a problem for some is that they will leak if you don't puncture them fully. This is easily corrected by lifting the open/close lever once and closing a second time. Now
7113;B004K30HO2;A386V13DFLUWDA;Huck2428;1;1;4;1317686400;disposa cups & filters;These work fine. All I really wanted to try were the paper filters

7116;B004K30HO2;A1U0QKJ52MSS56;Shirley;1;1;4;1308182400;Better;These cups are simple and easy to use the only drawback is the fact that maybe 1/3 of the cups get caught in the unit when you open. However

7118;B004K30HO2;A1NFUA27YNWQCP;Janice Holland O'Keefe;5;7;1;1315180800;Real BAD idea;These K-Cups have damaged something causing the water to not come through my already made K-Cups. I now have to put a ready made in and puncture it then open it and turn the K-Cup and puncture it again for the water to come through. I think the material in the disposable K-Cup is too heavy and damages the needle on the bottom.
7119;B004K30HO2;A1D8OFF2E5CPXD;Macphreak4Evr;0;0;5;1343174400;a must for anyone who thinks K cups are too expensive;I purchased these on a whim

7124;B004K30HO2;A156DFT2SC8RRF;Chaniemcd;0;0;4;1338595200;Good product;These cups are usable as stated.  They are exactly what I was looking for which was a less expensive method to have coffee.  They do leak slightly but not too bad. Not sure if it makes the hole's a little larger than the prepackaged cups.  But on the high side

7131;B004K30HO2;A1AV9FXFHM50WM;Chief Mike;0;0;2;1331510400;Not very good for me;The basic problem with this product is that unless you load a VERY small amount of coffee in the filter

I was excited for my new toy but my joy quickly turned into dismay when I saw how expensive the little cups cost.  I love coffee and have always bought beans to grind.  I was DELIGHTED when I found these wonderful little disposable filters to use with my Brewer.  Now I have the best of both worlds!<br />I placed my order and to my surprise they showed up 3 days later!

Messy and did not make a good cup of coffee.  Cost including shipping to me was .36/filter cup plus coffee. Don't think it is worth it as I can buy a Green Mountain K-Cup for around .54/cup and they are perfect every time.

The only thing that needs to be improved on is that the edges of the filter need to be trimmed down to prevent leakage.

The second time just salt and it was great!  We placed it in baggies and took it to the movies.  Okay - so maybe that sounds a bit cheap however our popcorn was fresh

It's probably a bit overpriced but I was having alot of difficulty finding any gingerbread mix in the grocery store. I use this mix to make gingerbread muffins with diced pears and dried cranberries. I'll purchase another six boxes when I run out of mix. A good buy and good product.

I am focused on eating nutrient dense food and am avoiding putting into my mouth non-food items for entertainment only. I love crunchy foods and this is great. The flavors are all good except don't like the sweet maple and cinn. flavor as much.<br />My family doesnt like them because they are not evolved yet

7295;B0000V1B4I;A1M09HETLCY39B;Holly;5;5;5;1186704000;Great Tea but need a filter!;I love this tea and have no complaints!!!  I just want to comment on how the tea is packaged.  It comes loose in little plastic baggies so if you want to use it you have to have some sort of filter.  We have an iced tea maker and used a cone coffee filter which works just fine.  I did buy a 2 inch tea ball but the loose tea just falls right through it so I guess I didn't buy the right thing.

7302;B0000V1B4I;A6IFJIX69Z1HY;Elon Smith Elon;0;0;5;1314057600;Excellent product;I purchased this product mainly to try out the different flavors of tea. When I find the flavor I like I will probably buy a case of it. China mist tea taste great. As for those who have problems with tea leaves getting in the tea don't worry. I went to the local supermarket (HEB in Texas) and found empty tea bags in a box for about $5.They work great. Fill with tea and fold top and staple.
7303;B0000V1B4I;A1Q4C3FBFQUFHU;Jennifer E. Hernandez;2;4;3;1232150400;Great taste...pain to strain;You know I really do love this product. I wish I could give the tea 5 stars because it really does brew up a very pleasant tasting iced tea that needs little sugar or other embellishments. The problem is it's loose and when you  are trying to make a big jug of it with two packets of tea it is a huge mess to strain. And ordinary double mesh strainer is not fine enough. I don't have coffee strainers in the house so I had to line a mess strainer with paper towels and it took forever to strain. But when I strained it with just my mesh strainer there was a ton of tea in the jug. I wish the variety pack came pre-bagged like the smaller boxes of tea do.
7304;B001EO5OSO;A27EP0V45FE6WV;Josh;3;3;1;1252627200;More like pancake syrup.;I bought this item thinking it might be equivilent to Starbucks or Davinci Hazelnut syrup but it's not. At first it tastes like Hazelnut then you get the flavor of cheap pancake syrup followed by an aftertaste that can best be described as tasting stale. The price is only slightly better than what I can get the Davinci Brand at Sam's club but the quality is far lower in my opinion. For hazelnut fans I suggest avoiding this particular brand.
7305;B001EO5OSO;A12Q4ZTTC4G1DM;Joseph Gula Joe G.;2;2;1;1249862400;1 STAR TO MUCH!;I'm sorry I bought this brand. It leaves a lousy after taste in your mouth.No wonder Amazon is giving .99cent shipping on this item. STAY AWAY!!! AVOID!!!!

These came in a multipack carton.<br /><br />These are not only items by Bob Red Mills --there are many--and if grains and nuts and seeds are in your diet..your childrens diet or even your pets diet.....then I cannot recommend this line enough to you--for fresh ....healthy eating !<br /><br />Try them !

Cookies and pies made with this Splenda blend - which does contain some sugar - taste the exactly the same as they did before.  Great stuff!  And it's gluten-free too.

They wont stop until there customer is completly satisfied. I ordered some winter black truffles from them and got my package lightning fast but came to find out that it wasnt what i ordered. I called JR and they said they sent better quality black truffles that cost more for the same price and this story doesnt end they even sent a jar of the original truffles i ordered just so i can taste the diffrence FOR FREE!!!!!!!!! Name another seller that would do that.

I ordered these truffles and recieved them securely packaged and protected to ensure they arrived safely and as quickly as possible.  I am even planning a special dinner with friends entirely based around the truffles I ordered as I was so please with them.<br /><br />  I also saw the other products this company carries - the attention to detail and the information provided on each and every product is outstanding - just like their quality (i.e.: Saffron).  I have found my gourmet source from now on!

Every review raved about the excellent service provided by JR Mushrooms.  I phoned them to ask a question about refrigeration vs shelf storage and got a voice-mail.  I left a message and five minutes later the man himself personally called and gave me friendly and professional answers to my questions.  I ordered these truffles and several other items.  The next morning there was a little personal e-mail from JR thanking me for the order and by noon the order had arrived

We sauteed them slightly and also tried them as is shaved. The price as some have mentioned reflects what you get for truffles.  Spend your money on white truffle oil you'll be much happier

About 6 months ago we started giving our rat terriers Greenies after my vet told me about them.  We couldn't afford $400 +  each to have our dog's teeth cleaned (and there is just no way these dogs would let me brush their teeth) so we tried these.  What a difference it made!!!!  The tartar an plaque buildup on my 11 yr old girl is almost completely gone and my 6 yr old boy's teeth look like I had them professionally cleaned.  The added bonus is Greenies make their breath smell great and my dogs love the taste of them!

7586;B000CQ6KSI;A3LR47S4I7Q0NS;John Doe;0;0;1;1330560000;So so;This is twice as expensive as basic box Mac and Cheese.  It is just so so in taste.  If you check the ingredients it is not much different than other Mac and Cheese.  The cost does not justify the ordering.  I will not be ordering from Amazon again.  The cost is much cheaper at a big box chain.

I know he enjoys the visual appeal of the coarse ground salt and I was tired of buying the $2.99 use-and-toss grinders of salt at the grocery store.<br /><br />As far as this salt goes
7598;B0009EIOPK;A2JVT93T0CZGEI;Kelly A. Burns Kelby;3;3;5;1263427200;Best (and easiest) Bread Ever!;This has to be the best and easiest bread machine mix I've come across.  Incredibly simple directions and impossible to fail.  Plus the loafs come out perfect everytime (I've had issues in the past with getting whole wheat flours to rise as well as white flours).  I've purchased this collection several times and will continue to do so.

The single mixes worked well as they included yeast packaged separately in the mix.  My machine states clearly not to get the yeast wet
7602;B0009EIOPK;A3OKJDYAFXAJ4K;Linda;0;1;1;1323216000;bread;The bread has a good taste but does not rise properly and only makes 1/2 loaf.  I checked the temp of the water as suggested with bad results.  After raising the temp to 100 degrees I got it to rise to 3/4 loaf.  Pretty expensive for the quality and I won't buy again.

I learned that feeding your dogs the right food from an early age is key to keeping them healthy and with you for as long as possible.<br /><br />This by far is one of the best Natural foods I have purchased and my dogs just (Love) it..  The Holistic Primitive is high in Protein and very well tolerated by sensitive stomachs.  This food has never been recalled and is made in it's own plant

I would recommend buying some type of planitarium for them.  They need a warm humid space.  Only use distilled water.  NOT FILTERED!  These plants are very delicate when it comes to the water you give them.  I would even go so far as to buy a guide book.  Don't buy the happy plants.  It's a good book for a kid. But it's not a guide on how to raise these plants. These plants are a great conversation piece for house guests.  Need I say more? ENJOY! Chazz

We used to buy their milk in cartons at Walmart and it was good.  The only problem was that we live so far from a Walmart store that we would run out of goat's milk between trips.  We decided to try the powdered and found that it mixes and stays mixed very well and tastes exactly like the liquid milk in the cartons.  Of course it stores easily and indefinitely and we highly recommend it to anyone who wants or has to drink goats milk.

My little girl loves it and it gives me the piece of mind knowing that I am not feeding her a huge amount of sugar with mainstream formulas.  Not to mention the other things they have found in them recently.  This is the closest thing to mothers milk.  If your baby spits up a lot you should definitely try this stuff.  My little girl hasn't spit up since I switched ever.  Love it.  Just wish I could buy even more at a time.

I use a gallon container and mix the whole can (3 quarts) at once with luke warm water and it works out perfectly. I really like this company and their product and love that this milk is also Vit D fortified.  Once my son gets older and he consumes less milk we will transition to the fresh goat milk

We have always drunk Maxwell house coffee and even when I was a child my parents used it.  It is one of the best coffee brands available.  As we have gotten older we needed to consume less caffeine and we actually brew a mixture of part of this coffee and part of the Maxwell House Decaf blend.  It helps us reduce our caffeine and we still get to enjoy our coffee in the morning with just a little kick in it.<br /><br />The price of the coffee here is about the right list price but the shipping is a killer adder.  On sale at a local store we get it for less than half the price and no shipping.  This is a very good product and I recommend it to you.

I had been monitoring my blood pressure at home and it was good but usually when I see the doctor it shoots up because I am nervous but not this time.  My doctor was thrilled.  I totally believe that this tea has lowered my blood pressure and I will continue drinking it.  I steep it for 10 minutes.  I have two cups after breakfast and one cup after dinner.  It tastes good and I don't put any sweetener in it.  I highly recommend it as it did work for me.

7940;B000RHXIGO;A34RY61WUGF6UW;Darryl W. Ray;1;1;5;1255392000;Great Buy;I have previously brought habanero powder from a gourmet store at The Grove in LA.  It was roughly 3 oz for $5.95.  This has the same great flavor and intensity that a habanero powder should have.  We use it to season fried fish and chicken and all braised meat dishes.  I highly recommend buying this product.

Saw a recent Dr. Oz show with Andrew Weil and he had a great Puttanesca recipe and one of the ingredients was dried red pepper.  By the way the recipe is just as good without the tuna.  I sprinkle a little of my Habanero powder as a substitute for the red pepper flakes.<br /><br />You don't need much of the powder it is very good quality

8021;B004SISLQ0;A19MMYMZO363KM;Lincoln County Mt Focused On Pinecones;1;2;4;1276214400;Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.;I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.

Unfortunately they display Fluaid picture on the Amazon website and their own website but the words are COLDAID.  THere is a separate product for Coldaid.  Regardless -- if you order the FLUAID on AMAZON you will get the COLDAID...the picture is not the product...the words under the drop down menu are worthless...as they all default to the same product COLDAID.

I'm not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??  The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3.

There isnt much she doesnt like but she sure doesnt like this stuff.  It looks like a weird mushy green stuff.  I am sure it is super healthy but she didnt like it at all.
8035;B004KAHKEU;A30ZHGC7FX6H4V;A.S;0;2;2;1298678400;Weird texture;The grains make this food really flakey. It just doesn't stick together and was falling off the spoon. A major mess really. It also doesn't have a zip lock top and I thought it did like many of the other pouch foods and took this with us out to dinner. I ended up putting the leftovers in a plastic baggie. My baby also was not a fan of this at all and she is not a picky eater. Even my dogs turned their nose up at it and I thought it tasted pretty nasty.

He has some separation anxiety and they can help keep him calm. It takes him about 15-20 minutes to eat but it is long enough for him to calm himself down. I just make sure he keeps it off white stuff. The red  center bleeds a little if he drops the wet side down or a piece gets broken off and falls on a light surface.  My dog will chew on one end then leave it if he gets distracted then come back and chew on the other end and the wet side dies surface he is on. I have been able to clean it out of stuff easily enough but it is a little bit of a annoying that I have to. I also wish they were cheaper.

The biggest problem was of course everything was written in German. Since you have a computer just go to a translation website and scan in the instructions and have them changed to English. From there you can use the product.

In the past the instructions were in English on the packet but I don't recall what they were. Now it is entirely in German and no one I know speaks a word of the language. I don't have a scanner so one of the solutions suggested won't work.  Don't buy before realizing that if you don't speak German and have no one to translate you are in a pickle.. I have 10 packs now!  Another thing

I was told that the packaging has been changed and no longer states aluminum free but natural.  It would be helpful if Amazon clearly stated that the packaging has been changed by Bob's Red Mill so that one will not be ordering Bob's Red Mill Aluminum Free Baking Soda when this is no longer an item.  It would save wasted time by customers who are trying to rectify  what was sent when it appears that a name change took place.  It would also spare vendors from receiving less than excellent reviews.

The content was securely packed and I was not worried that the milk got 'dirty' during shipping.  The price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the expiration date.  It is Mar 2012 which is not too far away.  I just bought one from Target(because I forgot to bring one and my toddler was restless) and it has an expiration date of Sept 2012.  Overall

8314;B003VXFK44;A1B5T3IUHLZ2UU;Stacie Gregory Thriftymama;7;10;1;1295222400;FLAVORED COFFEE??;Nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored. I'm still not sure what flavor it is. Some type of nut. I wrongly assumed that Jamaican coffee would be similar to the Blue Mountain coffee which Jamaica is known for! How silly of me to assume that! I hate flavored coffees so I was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee. It only says flavored very small on the box so I didn't notice it before I opened it. Hopefully I can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee-flavored coffee for myself!
8315;B003VXFK44;A16ZCEER1OK7XZ;Gp;4;6;1;1305590400;misleading;No where in the description does it mention that this is a flavored coffee.  By the name I thought it was a Jamaican Blue Mountain blend but its flavored with a weak tasting hazelnut.  Not very good

My favorite is Timothy's Rainforest Espresso because I like a bold coffee.  But others that prefer something milder say that Breakfast in Bed is their favorite.  I like it to but only when made as a stronger brew.  I have purchased maybe 15 boxes of this since it came out.

The aroma that it gives off while brewing transports me to a tropical island somewhere.  The flavor of the coffee is very subtle and leaves no after taste at all.  A great new addition to my coffee line up.

The KCup actually makes a good full cup of coffee.  it could be a tad stronger but overall it is really good.  I still prefer the Senseo Pods to the KCups though.

8496;B003VXFK44;A3PJ0TNZOJ2MCI;Shannon Hill;13;15;3;1299456000;Good taste but secretly  DECAF;Taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before I mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning.  Small print on the bottom of the box (I mean 6 point font) tells this.  Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine. I don't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale.

8520;B003VXFK44;A137QZWAFT6MG2;Eb;0;0;1;1310169600;I don't enjoy this  coffee ;Probably because it doesn't taste like coffee.  It is flavorless.  I saw the good reviews and thought I'd get a couple boxes and now I'm stuck with a bunch of k cups that I don't want to drink because I'd rather literally drink any other k cup I've ever tried.  As you can see I'm not a fan of these k cups.  These are the worst ever.

I was looking for a stronger vanilla flavor but after trying it I enjoyed it a lot. It was light and smooth and left no aftertaste.  I would recommend this to others.

One of the side benefits is the opportunity to experiment with different K-cups. I have already tried half a score. Some seem pretty tasty at first--until one taste something that is even better. Some early K-cups that I graded highly don't compare too well with later brands that I have tried.<br /><br />Wolfgang Puck's Columbian Dark Roast Noir is one of the better products that I have tried. It has a bold taste

Wolfgang needs to correct this flaw in packaging.  I will not order again because of the waste.

Typically Sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well.<br /><br />I am wondering if they made a bad batch or gave it the wrong label.<br />It is **NOT** bold.  It is extremely mild and smoky tasting.  Not a single member of my family liked it and that's very unusual.<br /><br />I'm going to contact the company to see if they'll exchange it or refund me.  It is THAT bad.

8611;B003VXFK44;AMEEXXHSFDS3Z;Tito Lover;4;4;2;1287360000;Just blah...;It seems the flavor selection on Amazon has been limited these days to some variation of hazelnut
8612;B003VXFK44;A2H74FIBDN5NMR;M. Prieto Havanese Friend;4;4;5;1286150400;Delicious! Amazing for a decaf coffee.;This is a fantastic decaf coffee. My parents love decaf but there aren't many out there they enjoy. We've been drinking Timothy's decaf Colombian and we bought this to try it. Fantastic! I would definitely buy this again and again. It's smooth and not bitter. It's not super strong so don't expect it to be like a cappacino. This is a really great Colombian cup of coffee. You won't miss the caffiene.
8613;B003VXFK44;A2ZAO73BLTJ69P;Bonnie Caroprese Bonton;4;4;5;1282867200;Great cup of coffee;I like my coffe of the milder but tasteful side.  I thought this was a great cup of coffe I compare it to Timothy's dounut shoppe.  Full flavor but not acid.  This is for people who want a lighter cup of coffee
8614;B003VXFK44;A2ARL5R5P6EL7D;Ric;6;7;1;1295136000;Never again;I tried a double boxes of this when the Donut Shop  coffee I usually order was unavailable.  While the coffee is pretty good the cups suck.  A full 1/3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable.  They are slow to brew(coffee maker has to work very hard) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water.  Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.  They could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee.  I believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable.
8615;B003VXFK44;A1FTO7E15UF6CS;Katherine A. Smith Kathy;0;0;5;1292889600;Love it!;Jamican Me Crazy is the best coffee.  It is not too strong and has a unique taste.  No complaints here.  Highly recommend it.
8616;B003VXFK44;A1WH998KDXZB7A;H. Drum;0;0;3;1292457600;It's okay but I won't buy it again.;I like bold coffees and should have trusted the other reviewer who said it wasn't strong enough. This one has a watery finish to it and not very much flavor.  I'll be going back to Emeril's Jazz'd Up Decaf and trying the Coffee People's French Roast Decaf.  So far I've loved everything by the coffee people except the organic blend.  If you like strong coffee don't buy this but if you like a weaker coffee that you can see through you'd probably enjoy this one.

I purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag. It smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what I expected. I will stick to gloria jeans and timothys flavored coffees. This was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last I order of his brand. I thought maybe I got a bad cup but I brewed 3 and I opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same nastiness.

It used to be that we were always ordering the same brands

I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee.

It's delicious when added to pancakes and muffin mixes in lieu of regular vegetable oil.  It adds just a hint of flavor without being overwhelming.  And with the price that Amazon offers it for vs. what my local grocery store charges for a smaller amount

8812;B00060PTLO;AKXLOUG2VFVPN;Carole Brawner Grandma Carole;23;23;5;1126742400;Low-cost Latte;Medaglia D'Oro Instant Espresso Coffee is by far the best way to make a latte in the comfort of your home and it's also the cheapest!  I use it to make an awesome vanilla latte - just put two (2) spoonfuls of the Medaglia D'Oro espresso in a coffee cup and add about 2 shots of hot water and mix.  Place a shot of vanilla syrup in a tall glass(more or less according to individual taste). Next add enough cubed [not crushed]ice to fill the glass 2/3rds of the way up.  Then fill the glass with enough cold milk to cover the ice.  Pout the hot coffee mix over the milk and ice and stir vigorously until mixed.  Add more ice as needed and then pour enough half and half to color the coffee mix to a yummy caramel color.  Delicious and cheaper than the espresso stands (once you have the ingredients on hand).  Medaglio is also great in recipes that call for instant espresso.  Not all stores carry this product so I order from Gristedes through Amazon.com.

I don't like the standard company coffee at work. I came across Medaglia D'Oro in a HEB store in Houston.  It just looks more interesting than coffee.  I was actually hoping it wouldn't be as strong as espresso but not as watered down as instant coffee. I am glad I bought it.  It has the same consistency at espresso but not as strong in taste.  I am probably using more water that what is suggested on the directions.  I work 3rd shift

Last year with all the wildfires I decided to load my camper as a quick bug out vehicle for me and my three dogs. I have been vacum sealing thier dry blue buffalo kibble but it takes up a lot of room. I read a review about this dehydrated dog food from a person takes thier dog camping all time and this was the perfect solution for them and decided to give it a try.

Now I am getting the larger package so we don't run out.  My Chinese Crested suffers allergies to poultry and grains and was pretty much limited to a red meat diet.  Since she is a hairless variety she was on a red meat formula coated in herring oil for her skin.  The herring left her with fish breath all the time.  This is a great alternative to the fish because the richness in omega 3 and 6 fatty acids and no more fish breath!!  Since she has been on this her skin quality is much better.  This is also great to mix with kibble if you have a picky little eater like I do

It has a really wonderful and complete flavor- not like a lot of the decafs on the market that are just missing the kick. I use a Jura Capresso super automatic to make my espresso- it works lovely in the bypass funnel on this machine (since it is pre-ground). The flavor stands up nice to milk for capuccinos and lattes. This is my every day decaf espresso. I haven't found anything better and I've tried a lot. The Illy decaf is comperable in flavor/ quality but at about double the price the Illy just isn't worth it.

I noticed that their affiliated deli sold LavAzza and I asked if that is what they brewed for the restaurant and was told yes.  I immediately went to Amazon and ordered and I am not sorry.  What a great price for an excellent cup of coffee!  Now I get the restaurant flavor without spending the restaurant price!

I'm still not sure what flavor it is. Some type of nut. I wrongly assumed that Jamaican coffee would be similar to the Blue Mountain coffee which Jamaica is known for! How silly of me to assume that! I hate flavored coffees so I was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee. It only says flavored very small on the box so I didn't notice it before I opened it. Hopefully I can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee-flavored coffee for myself!

The aroma that it gives off while brewing transports me to a tropical island somewhere.  The flavor of the coffee is very subtle and leaves no after taste at all.  A great new addition to my coffee line up.

The KCup actually makes a good full cup of coffee.  it could be a tad stronger but overall it is really good.  I still prefer the Senseo Pods to the KCups though.

9205;B006N3IG4K;A3PJ0TNZOJ2MCI;Shannon Hill;13;15;3;1299456000;Good taste but secretly  DECAF;Taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before I mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning.  Small print on the bottom of the box (I mean 6 point font) tells this.  Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine. I don't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale.

Typically Sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well.<br /><br />I am wondering if they made a bad batch or gave it the wrong label.<br />It is **NOT** bold.  It is extremely mild and smoky tasting.  Not a single member of my family liked it and that's very unusual.<br /><br />I'm going to contact the company to see if they'll exchange it or refund me.  It is THAT bad.

9321;B006N3IG4K;A2H74FIBDN5NMR;M. Prieto Havanese Friend;4;4;5;1286150400;Delicious! Amazing for a decaf coffee.;This is a fantastic decaf coffee. My parents love decaf but there aren't many out there they enjoy. We've been drinking Timothy's decaf Colombian and we bought this to try it. Fantastic! I would definitely buy this again and again. It's smooth and not bitter. It's not super strong so don't expect it to be like a cappacino. This is a really great Colombian cup of coffee. You won't miss the caffiene.
9322;B006N3IG4K;A2ZAO73BLTJ69P;Bonnie Caroprese Bonton;4;4;5;1282867200;Great cup of coffee;I like my coffe of the milder but tasteful side.  I thought this was a great cup of coffe I compare it to Timothy's dounut shoppe.  Full flavor but not acid.  This is for people who want a lighter cup of coffee
9323;B006N3IG4K;A2ARL5R5P6EL7D;Ric;6;7;1;1295136000;Never again;I tried a double boxes of this when the Donut Shop  coffee I usually order was unavailable.  While the coffee is pretty good the cups suck.  A full 1/3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable.  They are slow to brew(coffee maker has to work very hard) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water.  Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.  They could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee.  I believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable.
9324;B006N3IG4K;A1FTO7E15UF6CS;Katherine A. Smith Kathy;0;0;5;1292889600;Love it!;Jamican Me Crazy is the best coffee.  It is not too strong and has a unique taste.  No complaints here.  Highly recommend it.
9325;B006N3IG4K;A1WH998KDXZB7A;H. Drum;0;0;3;1292457600;It's okay but I won't buy it again.;I like bold coffees and should have trusted the other reviewer who said it wasn't strong enough. This one has a watery finish to it and not very much flavor.  I'll be going back to Emeril's Jazz'd Up Decaf and trying the Coffee People's French Roast Decaf.  So far I've loved everything by the coffee people except the organic blend.  If you like strong coffee don't buy this but if you like a weaker coffee that you can see through you'd probably enjoy this one.

I purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag. It smelled like buttery cheese and the taste was not what I expected. I will stick to gloria jeans and timothys flavored coffees. This was my first wolfgang puck kcup and will be the last I order of his brand. I thought maybe I got a bad cup but I brewed 3 and I opened the other box and tried those since it comes with two boxes and same nastiness.

It used to be that we were always ordering the same brands

I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee.

9373;B006N3IG4K;A3UROAHZHOIMTR;Maria Andrewsm51;0;1;2;1318896000;Mediocre;This coffee is only mediocre in quality. I do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do I like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date. The only reason I am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that I paid very little for it by using a credit I had at amazon payments. I do not recommend this coffee.

This product was offered at $19.95 and I was willing to purchase it but it immediately went up to $26.95. It is not really worth $19.95 and is certainly not worth any increase. Additionally

9462;B000UBDKII;A2K1ZNGMJD5P1T;L. Merrill Oh Lady;0;0;5;1340409600;Senseo Paris French Vanilla Coffee Pods;I enjoy flavored coffees.  French Vanilla is a favorite.  I only wish Senseo would offer more flavor varieties. It would also be nice if a variety of flavored coffees could be sold as a pack of 6 (example 3 hazelnut and 3 French vanilla or 2 of 3 different varieties). These pods are easy to use and cheaper than area store prices.  It's more convenient to purchase online.  Not all stores carry pods for Senseo coffee makers.

9474;B000UBDKII;A1XKL83T4US153;Bev Delong;0;0;5;1298851200;Great Vanilla flavor;This is the third Senseo brand coffe pod I have tried and it is my absolute favorite. I have tried Vanilla flavored coffees from several major gourmet coffee dealers and to me this coffee has the best Vanilla taste of them all. It is great to use in a single-serve type brew system or in a small 4-5 cup brewer [which is what I use]. The pod makes cleaning the brew basket a breeze and yet there is sufficient amount of grounds to give a good strength to the brew. I don't like my coffee as strong as some

All of my local stores either do not carry them anymore or are charging over $5 for one 16-count bag.  The 6 bag pack should easily cover the 3 month subscription time frame as I only use one pod a day.  The other great thing is that the package's expiration date is many months in the future so I know they are fresh!  I highly recommend subscribing to the automatic re-order system. Thank you Amazon.com!

I thought via auto ship would be a great way not to have to go to the store every other day to get some.  I ordered 6 cases of 12 ea.

Of the 5 remaining cases all of which did arrive but in not great condition.  All the cases were still sealed but 1 had 2 of the 33.8 ounce boxes split open and there were 3 other boxes in other cases that were stale (really had a rancid smell).  Therefore I cancelled the auto ship and have gone back to picking this up in the local supermarket.  Works out better

The first tree was thoroughly packaged with some type of foam insulation totally surrounding the tree. Impressive. Excellent condition!  The second tree came with no insulation but with a cord attaching the tree to the bottom of the box.  A couple of small limbs were broken off.  It is much better packaging with the foam insulation.<br /><br />The gift was assumed by the recipiant to be artificial (fake)

9650;B001LXYA5Q;A30SZD69HPEDB2;Chernobog;6;25;1;1234483200;Didn't work for me.;It didn't work for me.  Maybe its because I couldn't get past letting the whole tablet dissolve because to me the tablet tasted like vomit.
9651;B001LXYA5Q;AHNQ1JNX52P01;Pup Pointerpup;65;65;4;1234656000;Yep; it works!

9654;B001LXYA5Q;A2R8AISN4HCTW4;Nimue Mccleary;15;16;4;1239753600;it works... sorta;I do reccomend this product
9655;B001LXYA5Q;A1PGOV3JXFJMP9;Catch22;20;23;4;1276905600;I know what your thinking and yes it works for that too;Basically these tables change the way you taste acidic things
9656;B001LXYA5Q;A13GG2CONW46H4;Pete;9;9;5;1322784000;Unbelievable!;I saw an article on Yahoo and figured I would give it a try. This stuff was unbelievable. I ate healthy foods for the first try. Some carrots
9657;B001LXYA5Q;A3396CSGAR1JHH;Sarah;9;9;5;1321833600;It works and was fun.;I got these for me and my boyfriend to try but he refused to try it with me... at first. I tried to explain to him that it's just fruit put in a pill form but he was convinced it was some type of trick I was trying to pull on him. Anyways so I went to the store and picked up some lemons
9658;B001LXYA5Q;A21IAVTZO4PLA9;Webgrunt;10;11;5;1236816000;Amazing;After dissolving one tab on my tongue
9659;B001LXYA5Q;A2EBCYDVRAVX29;J. Hamer;6;6;4;1324339200;M-azing!;The mberry tabs work by altering your taste receptors and make sour tasting foods more sweet. I'm a high school science teacher
9660;B001LXYA5Q;AWOCU7SINJ6VJ;Mandy D;5;5;5;1321142400;AMAZING!!!!!;I just did a test run for a work party and I sampled raspberries
9661;B001LXYA5Q;AOEW3ERRG9UGN;Kayla;5;5;4;1317772800;It does change the way you taste...;It does change the way you taste but not to such a great effect that you are expecting. It's more of a pleasant surprise and not a OMG! surprise. It makes sour and most fruits sweeter. It makes beer taste like some sort of sugary juice (and I don't like beer). I would like to try cream cheese and wine which are supposed to be yummy. I recommend this product and I only need a half a tablet to last about 45 min to an hour. I wouldn't dare try spicy foods as they suggest on the package but they suggest pineapple
9662;B001LXYA5Q;A1W2XU5YMXAMHU;J. Hansen Busy Mom;5;5;5;1307664000;Miracle Fruit Success;My daughter had  me buy these for her 18th birthday party.  What a success!  The tablets arrived ahead of schedule so we could concentrate on other items.  The kids had a fun time trying out sour foods that became sweet after letting the tablets melt in their mouth. Everyone had a great time and really enjoyed them.  We're recommending them to everyone!
9663;B001LXYA5Q;A1BX7PE0IGDK9L;Daunte Go Gamecocks;5;5;5;1234396800;Wow;GREAT for parties.  This stuff actually works.  I was eating War-Heads
9664;B001LXYA5Q;A31I2WO6BYCG9X;Miss Jay;4;4;5;1302825600;Blown Away!!!;I purchased these tabs for my daughters flavor tripping party. I have never tried them out before so I invited a couple of friends over to experience this with me. I set up a spread our items
9665;B001LXYA5Q;A788O3EVM2RE6;James R. Williams;4;4;4;1298678400;Flavor tripping is fun!;After reading an article online a while back about flavor tripping
9666;B001LXYA5Q;AUYFLO4G86J1W;Anonymous;4;4;5;1292198400;So much fun - but don't forget the Tums!;My friend and I had a flavor tripping party for two.  We each dissolved one tablet on our tongues and then dug in to a plate full of lemons
9667;B001LXYA5Q;A5HG0O6UAV3NL;M. Meyer;3;3;5;1240012800;Miracle Berry Fruit Tablets;A friend referred me to these and told me that they were freaking awesome. I decided to give them ago and surprisingly they work extremely well.  I found that the taste of them
9668;B001LXYA5Q;A2H2PMNM66SGD;Sarah King;7;9;4;1258502400;It works; but watch out!
9669;B001LXYA5Q;A2A01HAVBKLDW6;Ben;2;2;5;1347148800;VERY cool;I ordered these after hearing about them from some friends. I was very skeptical if it would even really work noticeably and was even more skeptical about the pill form. But WOW! They really do work! It makes anything bitter or sour taste instantly sweet. I tried a few things and could definitely tell they were sweeter. But the most noticeable was the lemon. I really didn't even want to try it at first but i was told i had to. It tasted like the sweetest and most flavorful lemonade ever. Seriously
9670;B001LXYA5Q;A2Z0ZK5RALU4QE;Jenben Tx Hokie;2;2;5;1345161600;Chemo Patient Miracle;I purchased this for my mother who is currently undergoing some powerful chemotherapy. During her first chemo
9671;B001LXYA5Q;A2W91FNDURBJEB;Serp;2;2;4;1329696000;fun;Effects with some foods are more remarkable than others. I found balsamic vinegar tasting fairly like wine to be one of the most remarkable.
9672;B001LXYA5Q;A1HMK2OTMF0WU;Hdamc;2;2;5;1327449600;Lemons are amazing;I got these tablets to try them out to see if they really worked and to my suprise they do and they made lemons taste amazing. Most of the other items on the list did not taste much better to me but I am still trying some out.
9673;B001LXYA5Q;A11FO67PP4G7UB;C. Salomon It'S Just My Opinion;2;2;4;1327363200;Too sweet for my tastes...;After reading most of the reviews
9674;B001LXYA5Q;A15VWJF3E3ECJL;Zach A. Skelton;2;2;5;1325808000;just as advertised;Make sure you salivate a lot and don't swallow for best results. They'll typically last a few hours. They're a big hit for guests. You can even get by with half after you've had one or two. Doesn't work too well on liquors but most sour and acidic foods there is a very noticeable effect.
9675;B001LXYA5Q;A1VNOV3K0GS14L;Nikki Guerlain;2;2;5;1296518400;Neat stuff;Chewed a few of these and ate cheese

9677;B001LXYA5Q;A26L5GB12EMSJ8;J. Cornwall Jpc;2;2;5;1255305600;Very Unique;I took these over to a friends house and tried them with amazing results. After sucking on the pill and letting it dissolve for a few minutes
9678;B001LXYA5Q;A2PGOJFX4F8J3Y;Branden G. Thomas;2;2;4;1244073600;It's cool but no miracle;Before I bought this product I read several reviews saying that this stuff was amazing
9679;B001LXYA5Q;A8H7IAFIQ7GT6;J. Suppe;2;2;4;1239753600;Works well;The tablets do work but from I read in the description that half a tablet would work- it does
9680;B001LXYA5Q;A2GP8OWF7OMV9G;Edgar D;1;1;5;1349827200;miracle indeed;this is a great product. i gave a few tablets away to family and friends and they all loved it. it made anything with citric acid sweet

9683;B001LXYA5Q;A1I4RAVHL693YV;Anthony;1;1;5;1337990400;These berries are awesome!;First things first
9684;B001LXYA5Q;A24VFSMK05PXXJ;Durrendel;1;1;5;1335744000;Made for one interesting night!;Heard about these and simply had to check them out. Ordered a package and invited a few friends over after a huge shopping trip for an evening of flavor tripping. That is exactly what it was
9685;B001LXYA5Q;A3FCYRTZX25UXF;Megan;1;1;5;1335225600;Really Works!;Had fun with my family with the mberries
9686;B001LXYA5Q;A3HKCQX17RT9TZ;Barbara;1;1;5;1334966400;It really did help;It really did help my father is a cancer patient and. Didnt want to eat because the taste was no good.well the miracle berry gave him a good taste again
9687;B001LXYA5Q;A3VJMMW0OHTE9J;Aussie1492;1;1;4;1330473600;Mberry Tabs;Very interesting. The tablet itself doesnt taste that great but it melts pretty fast. The best stuff we found to try it with was apple and any citrus. It really sweetens the fruit. Its kinda crazy. It was fun.
9688;B001LXYA5Q;A1KVVR8NF2T28U;Jacob Jacob;1;1;5;1326326400;Amazing.;I just bought the mberry with slight concerns that it will not work. All those concerns went away when I tried it. It was a tingly feeling at first where ever it was on the tongue. I didn't notice anything. First thing i tried was a grape. I mean this was the most delicious grape I had ever tasted. I started try all the fruits and sodas i could. Amazing. People don't realize that you should use it on fruits and things with acidity. It is supposed to make them sweeter. Although it did make one of my cookies sweeter it wasn't nearly as dramatic as when I ate a lime. It tasted like lime-ade. I wouldn't suggest eating a bunch of lemons because this only affects your tongue. Not your stomach. When you buy these you run the risk that it won't work
9689;B001LXYA5Q;A3UHEWOFOS983L;Shmann;1;1;4;1323302400;fun to try;fun to try.  really
9690;B001LXYA5Q;AOY88K2ZG0R2B;Sashko;1;1;5;1320364800;Worked as expected;The effect was just as described and worked for about 20-30 minutes. I'd recommend trying it if you're interested. You won't be disappointed.
9691;B001LXYA5Q;ASS2CPF65HMPU;Scrimshaw;1;1;5;1308700800;Fun!;Fun! Changes taste of so many things! Try it! We almost drank a whole bottle of lemon juice after using this fruit that's how well it works!

9696;B001LXYA5Q;A3EMU00SV6D3TN;D. Frost;1;1;2;1277078400;Very slight effect....;Maybe the miracle fruit does not work for everyone. It had very little effect when I used it. I started with a clear pallet
9697;B001LXYA5Q;A3G1GQAY8ZR1K8;Jessie Wachter Jwalk;1;1;3;1263254400;Fun but not as effective;These tablets did work
9698;B001LXYA5Q;AST715OJDJXLD;Katharine Williams Kate Williams;1;1;4;1262736000;Pretty Fun!!;We found these tablets to be pretty fun! I suggest dissolving a full tablet in your mouth
9699;B001LXYA5Q;AJXRXTXGA858O;Simon Clark;1;1;5;1254355200;Brilliant product!;I took one of these tablets
9700;B001LXYA5Q;A2J1LWMV1VZBE3;Matthew Moore Mmoore;3;4;5;1232323200;They Actually Work!!!;At first i did not think they would work
9701;B001LXYA5Q;ANXK1IFMW4QSU;Suika;12;18;1;1282262400;Miracle actual fruits wayy better;These tablets hardly work in comparison with the actual berries. If you want flavor tripping then buy a box of the Synsepalum dulcificum berries or grow your own plant instead of wasting money on the pill/tablets. In my opinion.
9702;B001LXYA5Q;A8J6QQIG6J6UB;Frank Griffith Fgriffith;4;6;4;1233532800;It works as stated.;I tried two lemons after dissolving two tablets in my mouth.  It tasted just like lemonade.  One thing.  The package recommends 1 tablet.  That didn't work for me.  If you are a tad overweight two is better.
9703;B001LXYA5Q;A3HHBAXFG17TTW;Japeyez;2;3;5;1322611200;Miracle Fruit Tablets;I seen this product on Dr. Oz and I just had to try this out to see if it works. Yes
9704;B001LXYA5Q;A37H2JD9C8A2LY;Dung T. Bui;0;0;4;1349222400;works as advertised;I used the tablets and it made lime and lemon sweeter. It wasn't as sweet as all the other reviews claimed. The lemon tasted like a sort of ripe orange. I let my grandma try it
9705;B001LXYA5Q;AU9932BAWKPE7;John Doe;0;0;4;1343606400;It works; but not as expected.
9706;B001LXYA5Q;AIITBX9TQHSH5;James;0;0;3;1335916800;Eh;They do make sour stuff sweet for a bit
9707;B001LXYA5Q;A2XEE0AQEM5CCT;Daniel;0;0;5;1329004800;Miracle Fruit Rocks;I've had this a few times before and it is amazing. Last time I had it a half pill was one dose so I thought this was a bit cheaper than it turned out to be but it's still great and well worth it at $2 per dose. I like that it also came with some recommended foods to try. Lemons and limes are by far the best
9708;B001LXYA5Q;APFIDN46T4CAR;Matt;0;0;5;1328659200;Great get together idea;The mberry tablets worked great.  We tried a lot of the suggested pairings and most of them had some sort of fun taste after eating the tablets.
9709;B001LXYA5Q;A33PGSQRLN0C1Z;J. Stern Professional Slacker / Master Degre...;0;0;5;1326758400;These Are Seriously Cool;I was curious and decided to buy this product because of it (and despite the price).  It worked and is SERIOUSLY cool.  I followed the directions by putting a whole tablet on my tongue and letting it completely dissolved.  Sliced up a lemon and very warily put it in my mouth just to find that it tasted like a sweet lemonade.  There was only a slight tinge of sour.  I would have happily KEPT eating lemons
9710;B001LXYA5Q;A2QQPCYJZ7RTBS;Jaylee;0;0;4;1304380800;Wow.;It was crazy

9720;B001LXYA5Q;AW49WHWRPI14M;D. Napoleon;0;0;5;1260576000;Amazingly Fun!;This is my first time with the miracle berries in general. We got a bunch of friends over and everyone brought something. Oranges taste like the orange slice candies. And lemons taste like lemon drops. My favorite is the Christmas Beers that are available this time of year

9724;B001LXYA5Q;A3N4GH3C2M6039;~Bobbi~;1;2;3;1300838400;Miracle Berry as seen used on Dr. Oz;This tablet which is referred to as the miracle berry is used to distort taste of unpleasant(to you) items. You can let 1 dissolve in your mouth
9725;B001LXYA5Q;A30NIP79KXNSSC;T. J. Hawkins;1;2;4;1273795200;Works with a caveat;In reading the reviews here it is obvious that different tastebuds are affected very differently.  At first I believed the tablets did nothing even though I used a whole one.  Bitter foods and drinks still tasted bitter to me.  Sweet foods and drinks didn't taste any sweeter.  I was prepared to write the whole thing off as placebo effect on the part of some people but the positive reviews made me try again.  It was when I drank pure lemon juice that I noticed a difference.  Pure lemon tasted like lemonade.  So the product does work
9726;B001LXYA5Q;AHMBYY544LOGG;J. Smith;0;1;2;1350345600;Not as effective as competitor;I tried the Frooties mBerry and the effect lasted one hour for me. I purchased this version since it had excellent reviews and was a slightly higher price.<br /><br />This version lasted only ten minutes. I tried tablets out of three different packages from three different batches to make sure it was not a faulty batch. The results from each test was the same.<br /><br />I would not suggest this version of the product
9727;B001LXYA5Q;A2QUEVV6UTSZ1N;Tsquar3D;0;1;2;1334966400;Not satisfied;Quite disappointed. The pills don't last that long (it wears off after a few tries per pill) and not all the food items on the suggested list works. E.g. Cheese. Maybe it was a bad batch
9728;B001LXYA5Q;A7WA3UXGC1HYO;Alexander;0;1;3;1332460800;Not amazed;I tasted about half of the different foods on the big list of recommendations. Most tasted slightly different. Some got a sweet tickling in the mouth. I got the strongest effects from vinegar
9729;B001LXYA5Q;A1I7IWUGWT9DY1;~ Charliann Roberts ~;0;1;2;1324684800;Miracle Berry;Worked very little. Sweetened fresh pineapple but changed the taste to a bit bitter.<br />A sour orange it did help. It didn't work on anything else at all.

No chucks like most of the other brands. Milk chocolate is fine for those who enjoy that but for real chocolate lovers that enjoy the true flavor of dark chocolate
9746;B000KFXEYE;A10THUY91ILU8I;House Connoisseur;5;6;2;1196467200;Not if you've had the regular version; otherwise okay
9747;B000KFXEYE;A1E47XKSFNBCJ0;Pat Louise Gary;2;2;5;1296950400;Fantabulous;This product is out of this world - if you like chocolate and you like peppermint - you will fall in love with this.  I had it years ago and never could find it again until this past Christmas time at Costco as a seasonal item.  So when I found this I stocked up.<br />I love it..........
9748;B000KFXEYE;A2BIJMB2BITQUM;James Ridgway;2;2;4;1290470400;Very good hot Cocoa;I ordered this as the price was certainly right (6 1lb cans for less than $30) and the reviews were good.<br /><br />This is certainly a step up in the hot cocoa market. Better than just about anything you can find in the supermarket. I certainly prefer hot chocolate - but it can be time-consuming to make and it's tough to heat milk and melt chocolate at work or in class.<br /><br />This is the perfect compromise for when you want that chocolate drink and aren't in a position to 'do it right'.<br /><br />Very good taste and dissolves well. I always use a little more than it says on the can - with some cocoa that means it won't all dissolve - this is not a problem here.<br /><br />Certainly recommended.
9749;B000KFXEYE;A1LQQIADJGWIH3;Janet L. Cooper Catsjammies;2;2;5;1274918400;Yummy!;I purchased this product as a gift for my mom who simply loves this cocoa.  When the local supermarket where she purchased the cocoa stopped stocking it she figured that was the end of it.  Ha!  Little did she know that I would find a way to track it down on line.  And on Amazon!  She was surprised and pleased.  The price is good
9750;B000KFXEYE;A2VP85SINWDMRF;Nihonkabu Bibliophile;2;2;5;1235174400;The best hot chocolate;This is my family's favorite hot cocoa brand. The kids favorite flavor if mint chocolate.
9751;B000KFXEYE;A3OFGBLYKZOEVF;Pamela;1;1;5;1345507200;Incredible Hot Chocolate with Raspberry;I ran into this product at a bed and breakfast.  Unlike most hot chocolate mixes with another flavor component

9758;B000KFXEYE;A27NTHPTRXB766;Sandra L. Thornton Typingterror;1;1;5;1297987200;Best I ever tasted;Without a doubt this cannot be surpassed. I am always so conscientious about calorie count until I took a sip of this. I will just ration it for special moments. Even the cat's nose was twitching from the delightful scent. It is hard to believe that it was made in USA. If my daughter is lucky I might send her some at Christmas. It is a good thing I live alone or else I would have to hide it.
9759;B000KFXEYE;A3TLSKZPPH6OV1;Matthew Brillhart;1;1;3;1297123200;Pretty good;So I am a huge Chocolate Peanut Butter freak
9760;B000KFXEYE;AQY8Q7E8WZQ01;Neva K Walsh;1;1;5;1293667200;Stepens Candycane Cocoa;If you haven't tried the Stephens Candycane cocoa you need to try it  but only if you like chocolate and mint flavors.  It's great tasting.  The only problem is that I want it year around and it is only available in stores at Christmas.

I surprised him with a 6-pack of Stephen's Peanut Butter Cup Hot Cocoa.  It actually has little peanut butter cups in it.  They quickly melt into this delicious treat.  We highly recommend this product and will buy it again.
9766;B000KFXEYE;A3KSL5YJR7VUW4;Meghan;1;1;5;1263686400;Great even when made with water;I originally received this Mint Truffle hot chocolate as a gift

We like to drive around our neighborhood and look at the Christmas lights.  I always like to drink hot chocolate while enjoying this outing.  Oh My Gosh!  This hot chocolate was incredible. When I opened the can to make it
9768;B000KFXEYE;A4EZ1HCFW1UN;Kreg A. Nederbrock;1;1;5;1261440000;I agree!!;These folks are right.  This stuff is very rich and we just use skim milk.  Richer than the expensive chocolate shavings we have splurged on in the past.  The tins go along ways too.  The per serving cost is a fraction of buying the individual packets at the grocery store of other brands

9796;B000KFXEYE;A2A4WXW2F64TBI;Phosphor Essence;0;0;5;1258329600;The richest tasting hot cocoa I've ever tasted.;I bought a can of Stephen's hot cocoa over 5 years ago not realizing how good it was going to be. After I drank the first few cups I was hooked and could not find it anywhere again. I ordered it directly from the company for several years and even took several cans to the UK with me when we moved over taking care to make them last. I'm very glad to find this brand on amazon as it's rich flavor surpasses all others I've tried. If you love dark chocolate this is it. I haven't tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good. I may order some for stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br /><br />I also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug/cup. The pre-measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an 8oz cup and most mugs are 12oz so 2 packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way. If you'd like very rich hot chocolate you can use 1/2 milk and 1/2 water. You really don't need marshmallows.

I received these as a gift and found the gel-like liquor not to be very strong.  It was almost as if the liquor had been cut with sweet syrup and all the alcohol cooked out. A young child wouldn't even get a buzz from these.  The chocolate itself was OK -- better than Hershey's and Nestle but not as good as Godiva or Lindt.

Hoffman;0;0;4;1345248000;great all fruit snack;my 26 month year old spotted these on his own while shopping at the supermarket and I had to overlook the $8.59 for 3 oz bag and just be glad that was what he was asking for.  the amazon price is somewhat better but higher then Just Tomatoes actual website.  I only question why at this price is all the fruit not sourced from the USA?  I find that a bit hard to believe but I guess everyone has to make a living. some of the fruit is from Vietnam.  The crunch of the fruit satisfies when in the need for a snack.  the fact that he is getting used to a non sugar snack as a special treat hopefully will establish his appreciation for fruits in their natural state.  the 3oz bag does have a lot in it more then I would have thought before buying.

The seller gave early warning before shipping stating the weather had been abnormally hot and that they could not be held responsible for packages missed and left to sit in the heat.  I assumed that was not an issue considering my wife was at their home and aware the package would be arriving and I had also purchased priority shipping (additional $8+dollars).  No such luck.  Be sure whoever you are buying these from gives you absolute specifics before you buy.<br />Just to be fair

I was expecting to take a spoonful and swallow it like medication.  Instead I decided to mix it into my strawberry kefir.  I LOVE the way the little seeds swell up and give the kefir a little bit of a chewy texture.  it reminds me of those Asian drink places that add the Tapioca or lychee pieces to fruit smoothies.  They are great.  Be aware though after you eat these that they are little black seeds and they seem to love to stick between your teeth.  I look like some kind of nasty old redneck with chewing tobacco all over my mouth if I don't floss after eating them.<br /><br />This bag is a nice size and I think it will last a while.  Worth the price.

But enough people have said good things about these seeds that I decided to jump on the chia seed bandwagon and order up a bag.<br /><br />***Health Benefits***<br />- extremely high concentration of omega-3 acids (more than salmon)<br />- complete protein!  What does that mean?  I had to look it up too. :)  It means chia seeds contain all the essential amino acids your body needs.  So you could just eat nothing but chia seeds and survive.  Most veggies don't have that
